# Real-Time Data Processing Project

## Project Overview
This project involves real-time data processing using data from the [CEDA Catalogue](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/98ca52a0bcf94fc98155b7e914aa22a0). The project will utilize Azure services, Machine Learning (ML), and Power BI for data visualization.

## Objectives
- Ingest real-time data from the CEDA Catalogue.
- Process and analyze the data using Azure services.
- Apply machine learning models to derive insights.
- Visualize the results using Power BI.
- Present the findings to stakeholders.

## Instructions

### 1: Data Ingestion
1. **Set up Azure Event Hub**:
    - Create an Event Hub namespace in the Azure portal.
    - Create an Event Hub within the namespace to ingest real-time data.

2. **Connect to CEDA Data Source**:
    - Use Python or another programming language to connect to the CEDA data source.
    - Stream the data into Azure Event Hub.

### 2: Data Processing
1. **Set up Azure Stream Analytics**:
    - Create a Stream Analytics job in the Azure portal.
    - Configure the job to read data from the Event Hub.
    - Define the necessary transformations and aggregations.

2. **Store Processed Data**:
    - Output the processed data to Azure Blob Storage or Azure SQL Database.

### 3: Machine Learning
1. **Set up Machine Learning**:
    - Develop and train machine learning models using the processed data.

2. **Deploy ML Models**:
    - Deploy the trained models as web services in Azure.
    - Integrate the models with the data pipeline to provide real-time predictions.

### 4: Data Visualization
1. **Set up Power BI**:
    - Connect Power BI to the data storage (Blob Storage or SQL Database).
    - Create interactive dashboards and reports to visualize the insights.

2. **Publish and Share Reports**:
    - Publish the Power BI reports to the Power BI service.
    - Share the reports with stakeholders.

## Deliverables
- Azure Event Hub setup and data ingestion script.
- Stream Analytics job configuration.
- Machine learning models and deployment scripts.
- Power BI dashboards and reports.
- Project documentation and presentation.
