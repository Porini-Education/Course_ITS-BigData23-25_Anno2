742018385,January 2020,5.0,Decent hotel,"Super modern hotel in a really good location.The rooms are why this hotel is so good. They are modern, large, comfortable and very quiet. The technology that runs them is great, though a bit annoying with all the light it puts out - impossible to get the room pitch black. Bathrooms are fabulous. The spa pool is lovely with great views over Milan. I would recommend them having hours for kids to be able to use the pool, quite frustrating that they don't allow kids at all.Breakfast was decent but over priced. Other guests obviously felt this way too as we were the only ones ever there and the 6-7 waiters just hung around."
808143792,August 2021,5.0,August 2021,"Returned to Milan for the first time since the pandemic. Have always loved Armani for it's fantastic location, service, amenities, and overall aesthetic. Staff are lovely and helped arrange same-day dinner reservations at Michelin star restaurants, as well as a in-room Covid test prior to departure. The rooms are starting to show their age in terms of wear and are starting to feel a bit dated/stale, as would be expected after 10 illustrious years. The room control system is excellent, but the televisions could be larger, with better resolution and an easy way to cast content from a device. Armani Ristorante is one of my favorite spots in Milan for drinks/dinner, but unfortunately was closed due to Covid. Despite the small gripes, it remains one of my favorite places to stay when in Milan. Hopefully will undergo a small refresh or renovation in the near future, like the Park Hyatt Milan (my other favorite) is currently undertaking."
878021261,February 2023,5.0,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff","The hotel is beautiful as one would expect, what made the difference were the receptionists etc. who were very helpful and kind. I was feeling unwell when I checked out and was so impressed that the person on reception arranged a bottle of water to be waiting for me when got to the ground floor"
740655301,January 2020,5.0,my new favorite hotel,"One of the best thought out suites we have ever stayed in. PLUS we got upgraded to a higher level of suite and we are rarely upgraded, even on Centurian program,. The room was controlled by an ipad that was instantly understandable. no training needed. Every one made us feel welcome and could not do enough for us.the heated floor in the bathrooms were amazing.Restaurants and bar seemed ok but we had lots of plans in Milan and we did not use them. comp breakfast was fine."
745399028,December 2019,5.0,A very Merry Christmas  for someone who isn‚Äôt a Christmas person üòÉ,"My third visit and everything is just as excellent as before. I am not a fan of Christmas so wanted to get away from the nonsense for a few days - how wonderful to not have decorations everywhere. I have to call out the management and staff in the Armani ristorante and bamboo bar for once again dealing with my vegan diet so gracefully. Simply but exceptional quality food. As I‚Äôm interested in design I asked to see one of the hotel suits and the reception staff were more than happy to show me around and answer my questions. What a pleasure! The spa pool and gym are very comfortable and feel welcoming to me, not too big and imposing and the staff are friendly whilst being very respectful of your privacy - I really like that approach. I feel very comfortable here and I think that I‚Äôm going to keep coming back. It‚Äôs a place in which I can truly relax, where I feel that I fit in, and where my  expectations are always met.Thank you to all the staff."
802595672,July 2021,4.0,armani hotel milano,"arriving to the hotel door doesn‚Äôt take you to reception/ lobby, you have to take an elevator and there was no guidance ( people or sings). we just guessed it. before coming, i have made more than 2 calls and 3 emails regarding a special request regarding my rooms ( to have them all next to each other), the receptionist was not informed and handed me cards of random rooms that are on the same floor. the receptionist did not offer to take us to the rooms, she just handed the cards which was a bit strange for such a hotel, so i asked her to. we had a 1 hour wait time in one room until the room issue was resolved. we have to take 2 elevators to get to our rooms or exit.check in area is pretty compact, so every time i passed by there was be a group of people standing waiting for their turn.  one guest with me had a "" handy man"" walking in on him while he was sleeping, with the do not disturb sign on the door. the hotel apologized verbally. i expected a fruit basket at least and a hand written card. strange again.room service was not a constant quality. one time i got my risotto undercooked and one time the pepper dispenser was empty. on the other hand, hotel staff were rather friendly, understanding and attentive. all my other requests were met perfectly. i was extremely happy with the wifi and the ipad controlled room. also the television had many channels from many origins.i have seen negative comments on house keeping but i faced nothing. all was great."
838119503,May 2022,5.0,Armani gets an ‚ÄúA+‚Äù,"When you enter the hotel, you are greeted cordially, your luggage is whisked away and you are transported to the reception area where you are welcomed again. Check-in is easy and then you are escorted to your totally fashionably (obviously) designed room with all the modern conveniences. An iPad has all the controls for the room, the curtains puddle beautifully, the bathroom is stunning in marble with a separate shower and tub, you can even close off the vestibule for a private food delivery. The staff is attentive and remembered us whenever we came by reception with a question. The food at the restaurant was delicious and beautifully presented. We are only sorry that we stayed only one night."
857062192,July 2022,5.0,Summer in Milan at Armani,"Spacious room, friendly staff and housekeepers. I loved how high-tech all the amenities were and how comforting it is to get everything done through the iPad, including opening the door and ordering in-room dining. Contact was minimized to the comfort of the guests. Mini bar was constantly restocked and receptionists were very helpful with guiding us around the city for shopping and food cafes. Also, an extra +++ was the location. Everything was walking distance!"
775289203,October 2020,5.0,Great!,"As far as I can this hotel is perfect. My bedroom was amazing, with a nice terrace and a great view. The pool  at 8th floor with the panoramic view is relaxing and astonishing. The possibility to control everything in your room with a tablet is very comfortable. the Hotel staff is kind and professional. As soon as Covid situation gets better I will go Back to Armani Hotel for sure."
808717285,September 2021,1.0,"Worst experience, racist staff foreigners are not welcome in Armani Hotel Milan.","Worst experience, rude and abusive staff do not stay here if your not Italian. I cannot believe I was treated like this. I even have mosquito bites from the bed sheets, room service was horrible, uncooked food and they gave me mango juice half glass or syrup only."
869387650,November 2022,5.0,I love this hotel,"It is truly difficult to find a flaw in this hotel because it is simply perfect. To start with, the reservation staff was patient and courteous, they even called us before we arrived to make sure everything was alright. Then from the moment we walked in, we were greeted with kindness. Then they upgraded us to an executive suite without us even asking.It kept getting better from that moment on. The bathroom is so comfortable and spacious, the AC worked wonderfly, and the amenities covered everything from the toothbrush to everything else. The suit was smart and we were able to control everything with an eye pad. Relaxing music was always playing in the  hallways. There was a business center. The breakfast was by far the best I ever had in a hotel. Housekeeping was always fast to respond. The room service was absolutely delicious. The location is in the city center. Really, I love this hotel."
889405632,May 2023,5.0,Outstanding time at Armani in Milan,Fantastic experience at the Armani Hotel in Milan.  From the moment of arrival until I left the staff at the hotel went out of their way to make my trip completely enjoyable.  Virtually all the staff recognized me by my name on each encounter.  The Jr Suite was perfect in every respect including the desk area where I needed to work for a couple of hours each day.  Restaurant at d bar were excellent  as was the fitness level.   And the location is spectacular.   Will definitely go back ASAP.
779338587,October 2020,5.0,Great Milano Hotel - Very Well Located,"This hotel is all you expect from Armani. Design, size of the room etc. Really enjoyed my time there. I was only disappointed by the Concierge service which was not able to help organize or reserve anything for me. A bit bad in such a great hotel."
837733277,May 2022,5.0,Thank you Lifestyle team,"This hotel deserves a lot more than the flak reviews you read.First time staying here for our anniversary.The hotel room is nice and comfortable. Mini bar complimentary - which is a really really nice touch.Special thanks and mention to Paolo from front desk. He was so patient with the check, trying to find us a room on a higher floor and when he couldn't, he brought us to the room allocated and walked us through the room details like lights, ipad etc. We had a small issue but he resolved it promptly and efficiently and really showed what it means to stay at The Armani - fantastic customer service! Just top notch! Thank you to the service team and front desk. We really enjoyed our stay.The only thing that we would like to suggest is an improvement of the WiFi. We stayed on the 3rd floor and the WiFi was patchy.But other than that, it was such a fantastic stay and thanks in no small part to Paolo.Stay here! Nice, central location, great breakfast and fabulous service."
923971481,October 2023,5.0,Stylish Armani in stylish Milan,"What an amazing stay! Totally stylish and such a reprieve in the middle of a bustling city. The location was incredibly central, you could easily walk to all the hotspots. The Armani amenities were amazing, all the bath products, the drinks and snacks in the room, even stylish slippers. They really thought of everything! It was visually stunning and the perfect spot to enjoy Milan from!"
793435259,June 2021,5.0,Amazing....every time,"I love everything about the Armani hotel, one week ago was my 4th time there and everything its always amazing. The service is excellent, they always think one step ahead to fulfill any wishes (even the man from the valet parking when we ask him if they had an item of personal care in the hotel or if there was some pharmacy around: he just told the housekeeping and this item was in our bathroom when we came back).  Service is great, the location is great, the breakfast, the branding with their own fragrance, creams, snacks, chocolates, etc...its perfect, one of my favorite hotel!"
904077271,July 2023,3.0,First class team,The team at the Armani were amongst the best I‚Äôve ever encountered. Friendly and helpful at every turn. Breakfast was truly amazing with unbelievably fresh fruit and vegetables. The room technology was cumbersome and overdone but the team was always there to help out. Overall we enjoyed our stay though I believe I would choose a bit more of a full service hotel in the future for the price point.
797695140,July 2021,4.0,Everything is beautiful about this hotel except the duty manager,"The Hotel is a 'go-to' place with an amazing design but it's people who do it. I want to say 'thank you' to Meghan from reception, be sure if you address her your request will be fulfilled efficiently. Restaurants have friendly and welcoming personnel but Lilia, Biagio and Pasquale are outstanding! Contrary if you don't want to spoil your mood avoid Luca with his arrogant and moody attitude and you will enjoy the property to the full!"
837350044,April 2022,5.0,Enjoyable trip,"It is not the first time we visit Milan but it is the first time in Armani Hotel, it was great that we chose this hotel, its location, quality of rooms, services and staff, everything was great, I will never forget Mr. Faisal, Mr. Simone and Mrs. Lara, and I apologize for forgetting the other names.Thank you everyone for their kindness to my children.The room type was a family suite consisting of two interconnecting rooms."
815655696,October 2021,4.0,"Good location, sleek hotel","Very sleek hotel and impressive to see. The location is excellent as it is just steps from high end shopping and walkable to the Duomo. The lounge and dining area are also very modern and cool. My criticism is the rooms themselves were not very functional, specifically the bathroom. There is almost no counter space for makeup. There are not many outlets. The outlet in the bathroom didn‚Äôt work, so I had to curl my hair sitting in the floor, using the refrigerator door as a mirror. The use of an iPad to control everything seems cool initially, but became annoying to turn on the lights and turn off the TV. Armani hotel is a nice hotel, but can use some modern updates to make it more functional."
746140752,January 2020,5.0,Amazingly Wonderful,"I loved everything about this hotel: the ambiance, the service and amenities. The staff is extremely attentive to your needs. At every turn was perfection! The breakfast selection was good, but prix course lunch was phenomenal. We also ordered room service for dinner, which arrived in no time. The spa offers a relaxing experience with wonderful views of the city. By far, this is one of my most favorite hotels and I will for sure be returning."
899355102,June 2023,5.0,Modern luxurious stay with very friendly staff,"We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights to explore Milan and do some shopping. The room we got was spacious with a large terrace. The staff was extremely friendly and helped us swiftly with all questions and requests we had. The location of the hotel is great, especially since it is right next to a metro stop"
767180856,August 2020,5.0,Great hotel in Milano,"My friend and I stayed at the Armani hotel for two nights and had an amazing time, I really recommend this hotel to anyone spending some days in Milano. The location was great, the service really good, the room very spacious and comfortable and breakfast incredibly good. We got amazing suggestions from the Front office team, particularly from Andrea who made us feel at home during our whole stay."
960223572,June 2024,2.0,The experience in the hotel,"I have been staying in this hotel for a long time since I was a kid. I was considering this hotel as my home in Milano. The interiors are nice. However, unfortunately, the quality of the services has declined very sharply. They don‚Äôt provide quality services anymore. They don‚Äôt care about the small details. When we arrived to do our check-in, there was no one at the door and we had to ring the bell for someone to come and take our luggage (They operate the same as the 3-star hotels). The quality of food at breakfast is low. The SPA team refused to amend our SPA booking, they are not supportive at all. I tried to speak with the hotel GM, but they refused. I spoke to another person at the reception and he took no action. If you are looking for a high-standard hotel, Armani is not your choice. Armani lags far behind Bulgari Milano and other top hotels in Milano. This will be my last visit to Armani. They have lost a very loyal customer."
796149648,June 2021,5.0,Amazing hotel with amazing staff,We stayed one night in Milan at the end of our Italy trip to catch an early flight. The hotel that we first checked into was a disaster! We talked to Luca about transferring to the Armani Hotel. He got us checked into our room quickly and effortlessly. The hotel and  room were amazing. We were so relieved and happy to be able to kick back and relax in our comfy room. The Bamboo Bar was great as well. We also enjoyed room service and a wonderful breakfast. My only suggestion would be to add more vegan options to the menus. This is a great hotel in a Milan and the staff is amazing. We would love to return one day and stay longer than one night! Thanks for making our time in Milan so enjoyable!
880048849,March 2022,5.0,Greatest Experience in This Stylish and Well Designed Hotel,"I stayed in Armani Hotel Milano a couple of times. As you probably know, this is one of the best hotels in Milan. Nice style, top quality, great service. If you need to book or order anything concierge would do it for you right away. Make sure to check the Armani restaurant which is on the 7th floor, great steak, pasta, deserts, wines, etc. Grazie Armani. I will be back."
962245373,September 2023,4.0,Excellent in everything except in service.,"Very spacious rooms and privileged location, very good taste in everything, but the problem begins with the service, I made a reservation with a corporate fee, which the attendant made the question to highlight at check-in I did not understand why.The space although beautiful is cold and does not make you feel at home, the SPA on the rooftop eh very good.The restaurant recommendation made by the concierge was basic and anyone could do it by looking at this site."
879630573,February 2023,5.0,Beautiful experience.,"This was the most beautiful hotel I‚Äôve stayed in. Top service, amazing modern amenities I haven‚Äôt experienced in any other hotel. Perfect location.I‚Äôd 100 percent recommend this place! Everything was perfect. We controlled everything in the room with our iPad, the lights, music, shades. This is an epic hotel."
832542622,March 2022,5.0,Excellent Hotel,"Stunningly designed hotel, with technological control in the room. Close to all the sites in the center of Milan.  An amazing team that generously responded to all our requests.  Free minibar for the entire stay including refilling every day, Late check out free of charge.  Receiving ‚Ç¨ 85 to use for extras at the hotel.  10% discount at Armani's flagship store."
820465142,November 2021,5.0,Best Hotel in Italy,I stayed at the Armani w/ my family in the family room (bedroom w/ a connecting room). The size of both the bedrooms and bathrooms were great. The hotel is first class but the service they provide during your stay is incredible. You never wait for any request and the staff goes above and beyond to provide great service. I would suggest this hotel over any other in Milan.
853813339,August 2022,3.0,Outdated by now,"Even the hotel was once well designed, many interior parts are now worn out and don‚Äôt work well. Shame the main restaurant is closed for the whole of August so you must go outside for dinner. Hotel is on a main road so plenty of noise and does not look special compared to several similar nearby hotels. Hotel staff are amazing though"
939952241,February 2024,5.0,Fantastic in every aspect!,"I stayed for 4 nights in an Armani Premiere Room. The internal layout is somewhat unusual in that the Reception is on the 7th floor, there is one lift going straight to that floor. To access the rooms you then take an other lift to go down to the floors with the rooms. Whilst this may be an unsual set up, it did not distract from the excellent stay. All the staff at the Hotel, Bar and Restaurant were extremely friendly and helpful, the room was spacious and well equipped, the Restaurant, as you would expect, is equally good. Altogether a fantastic experience. Ok, it is not cheap, all comes at a price but I am happy to pay for good service, and this Hotel definitely belongs into a class of its own. One of the few places that lived up to our expectations. Well done to all the staff to make this possible."
822331816,December 2021,5.0,City Trip,"I had the most wonderful and comfortable stay. The rooms are of a good size with a big and luxurious bathroom. The Spa has a beautiful view of the city, from al areas. Jacuzzi is nice and big. Sauna‚Äôs are 1-2 persons, but multiple of them and also with a view of the city. Location is great ofcourse!"

770262687,September 2020,4.0,CORRECT PRICE / QUALITY,"Good and well located hotel in the centre of Milan.The personel is very friendly, even the concierge for making bookings outside the hotel. Check-in takes too much time, especialy in this Covid19 period, so identity cards and credit cards can be mailed before check-in. Check-out was fast and sufficent."
751438023,October 2019,3.0,Expected better since it‚Äôs an Armani hotel,"The location is perfect! Some staff can be really friendly, some staff high attitude, so in a way it‚Äôs like gambling. Breakfast is lacking varieties. Service is very good, free drinks in the minibar. Spacious bathroom, but the room could be a bit small. Willing to give you another chance when this madness is over. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
756952074,August 2019,5.0,Nice modern hotel.,"Nice rooms, with lots of room. Very tidy and modern for Italy. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Bit of a walk from the main hub of the resturants but not too bad. Loved the Ferrari Factory. Thanks."

176863683,September 2013,1.0,Tecnologia inaffidabile ‚Äì responsabili assenti,"Quando siamo arrivati in albergo hanno sottolineato pi√π volte che l‚Äôalbergo √® tecnologicamente avanzato e che tutto sarebbe avvenuto dal telecomando.Peccato che quando siamo arrivati in camera l‚Äôaria condizionata funzionava a malapena e nonostante che dal telecomando avessimo messo al massimo la temperatura, questa  non si abbassava, siamo usciti e abbiamo fatto presente il fatto alla reception con preghiera di provvedere al malfunzionamento.  Infatti al ritorno la camera era anche fin troppo fredda,  e cos√¨ abbiamo deciso di abbassare la ventola sempre con il famoso telecomando, ma con nostra grande sorpresa questo non funzionava pi√π.Quindi abbiamo dovuto richiamare la reception che finalmente alle 23,00 ci ha mandato 2 tecnici per risolvere il problema, con mia grande sorpresa i tecnici hanno tolto un filo elettrico  che avevano messo nel pomeriggio per far funzionare al massimo l‚Äôaria condizionata, ma in questo modo erano consapevoli che il telecomando per regolare la temperatura non sarebbe stato pi√π in grado di funzionare.Infatti tolto questo cavo elettrico il telecomando ha ricominciato a funzionare e la temperatura si √® alzata, ma questa si √® alzata a tal punto che nella stanza ha ricominciato a far caldo, tutto era ritornato come nel pomeriggio quando l‚Äôaria condizionata non funzionava.Quello che mi rattrista sono questi espedienti malevoli di 2 tecnici che pur sapendo che la climatizzazione non funzionava hanno fatto orecchie da mercante, accompagnati anche da una ragazza alla reception che continuava a ripetere che tutto era stato sistemato e che non c‚Äôera nulla di anomalo.Notte terribile con un caldo insopportabile in camera e un risveglio con una temperatura a 27 gradi.La mattina dietro la minaccia di andare via finalmente ci cambiano camera risolvendo il problema, cosa che avrebbero potuto fare anche il giorno prima dietro le nostre lamentele e non portando avanti una condotta vessatoria e dilatoria.Finalmente siamo nella nostra nuova camera con una temperatura di 23 gradi , ma la sera al nostro ritorno in camera con grande sorpresa troviamo di nuovo che il telecomando non funzionava, questa volta non si poteva comandare niente , n√© luci, n√© tapparelle, n√© TV , n√© aria condizionata. (fortuna che la temperatura era rimasta sui 23 gradi cos√¨ abbiamo potuto dormire tranquilli).Il problema non sono  i guasti o gli inconvenienti che possono accadere, ma l‚Äôatteggiamento di tecnici e di personale che non affronta i problemi con l‚Äôadeguata professionalit√† e onest√†. Non parliamo poi dei responsabili o del direttore con cui non abbiamo potuto comunicare. Nessuno di quest‚Äôultimi si √® degnato di porci le sue scuse per gli inconvenienti accadutoci, cosa non degna di un albergo che porta il nome di uno stilista famoso e che ha messo sempre in primo piano il bon ton e la cortesia.Dulcis in fundo: Dopo la partenza mi accorgo di aver lasciato in camera la giacca e chiedo di rispedirmela al mio indirizzo, mi chiedono l‚Äôautorizzazione a pagare con la carta di credito, indispettito gli faccio presente che dopo quello che era successo forse avrebbero dovuto fare a meno di chiedere i dati della carta di credito, questa √® la loro risposta ‚ÄúPer la spedizione della sua giacca e del documento non possiamo purtroppo assumere i costi siccome il servizio viene fornito da una azienda esterna. Con il suo permesso procederemo quindi con il pagamento tramite carta di credito indicata nella autorizzazione.VERGOGNATEVI  (andate a fare un altro lavoro che questo non fa per voi)"

I clienti possono anche usufruire di un ristorante di altissimo livello ed all'ottavo di una spa, aperta solo alla clientela. Un particolare, di rilievo √® l'abolizione della reception, sostituita da un lifestyle manager, che si fa carico di ogni esigenza del cliente.

122783864,January 2012,2.0,"Design yes, hotel no","Despite its pure lines, the expensive materials, the bathrooms to die for, and the unique accessories, Armani is a poor travesty of a hotel. Both service and food are ridiculously bad, so much so that we had a few fits of laughter. Arriving at the hotel, the taxi driver had to bring my bag in since noone appreared to help. Suddenly, a lovely lady appraoached me and introduced herself as my'lifestyle manager', grabbed my bag, only to move it 10 feet away, and suggested we go up to the lobby. Thank god i had the insight not to accept to leave my bag downstairs. At the lobby on the 7th floor, i waited for 10 minutes up until the same lady appeared and took my passport away. Another 10 minutes and she came back to take me to my room. There were no other guests around so i cannot attribute this worst check-in ever to overwork. After the theatre we went to the lounge bar to have a bite. My friend's simple spaghetti with tomato sauce were inedible; apparently the night cook forgot the salt. As for my minestrone it was so overcooked that it had turned into mush. the next morning I checked the breakfast card: at 10 euros a plate i could have traditional muesli, special oatmeal, and cereals served with red berries. Smarter because of the previous night's culinary experience I asked room service for clarifications: traditional muesli wax kellog's out of a box, oatmeal the same. and the special cereal served with red berries was Speial K with red fruit.... No further comment needed. Dragging my own suitcase, i left as fast as possible to have a nice cappucino in a bar in via Manzoni....."
324814645,October 2015,5.0,Fantastica esperienza!,"Ho passato una notte in questo splendido hotel: Armani Hotel Milano √® un vero e proprio concentrato di lusso nel cuore del quadrilatero della moda milanese.Lo staff riesce a farti sentire unica, a partire dal momento in cui vieni accolta dal tuo LifeStyle Manager (grazie mille Antonio!), che ti accompagna in camera e ti fornisce in maniera precisa e dettagliata tutte le indicazioni utili al soggiorno. Io ho pernottato in una camera Premi√®re al 4¬∞ piano con vista sul cortile interno: ampia ed estremamente curata, sono stata accolta con un omaggio di frutta fresca, molto gradita.La camera √® un concentrato di tecnologia: √® presente un Ipad da cui √® possibile controllare tutto, dall'aria condizionata, alla tv, alla musica, alle luci, alle tende, oltre che accedere a info e servizi dell'hotel. Ho dormito benissimo, il letto era estremamente confortevole e la camera silenziosa, grazie anche alla sua ubicazione. Il bagno √® molto bello, tutto marmo e specchi, corredato da morbidi accappatoi e prodotti Armani Priv√©.L'unica cosa che mi √® piaciuta meno sono i corridoi, un po' troppo bui per i miei gusti, avrei preferito un'illuminazione un po' pi√π forte. Poco dopo il mio arrivo mi sono concessa un massaggio in Spa: la Spa si trova all'ultimo piano ed √® panoramicissima! E' fatta tutta a vetrate e la vista sul centro di Milano √® davvero spettacolare! Sono presenti lettini in cui rilassarsi, una magnifica piscina, cabine per la sauna, per il bagno di vapore e un corner in cui sono a disposizione degli ospiti snack (salutari!) e bevande.Il massaggio √® stato eseguito con maestria e precisione (la mia schiena sta ancora ringraziando Mohamed!), la cabina offriva un ambiente molto rilassante, con luci e musica soffusa: un momento di grande relax dopo una settimana pesante! Ho usufruito del servizio in camera per la cena: il menu √® vario e interessante, il servizio si √® dimostrato rapido, infatti ho dovuto attendere solo una ventina di minuti, e i piatti, oltre ad essere molto gustosi, erano anche presentati con grande cura all'impiattamento. L'indomani ho fatto sia la colazione che il brunch presso l'Armani Ristorante, al 7¬∞ piano dell'hotel: anche qui le ampie vetrate offrono una vista mozzafiato su Milano, dal Duomo, al Castello Sforzesco, ai nuovi grattacieli del quartiere Isola.Ricco il buffet per la colazione e ancora pi√π ricco quello del brunch, dove sono disponibili anche ostriche freschissime e deliziose. Ottime le tartare di pesce e ampia scelta di piatti, tra cui anche alcune alternative vegetariane. Merita una menzione speciale l'angolo dei dolci (anche se chiamarlo angolo √® davvero riduttivo!), ricchissimo, super goloso e anche di grande impatto visivo. In generale posso dire che la struttura dell'hotel √® ottima: oltre alla posizione, il design, lo stile e l'eleganza la fanno da padroni... d'altronde, stiamo parlando di Armani! Ma ci√≤ che davvero fa la differenza, secondo me, √® il servizio, vero tratto distintivo dell'hotel: tutte le persone dello staff con cui sono entrata in contatto, a partire dal Lifestyle manager, ma anche il personale del ristorante, della spa, del servizio di housekeeping, si sono dimostrati molto attenti alle mie esigenze, anche anticipandole, e con un livello di attenzione per i dettagli davvero altissimo.Camere eleganti e ambienti di design, pulizia impeccabile, servizio sempre rapido ma sempre preciso e attento, altissima professionalit√† da parte dello staff, unita ad un calore mai invadente sono gli ingredienti che rendono unica e totalizzante l‚Äôesperienza presso Armani Hotel Milano."

Si tratta di una propriet√† magnifica posizionata tra via Montenapoleone e via della Spiga e caratterizzata da un'eleganza in puro stile Armani. La lobby si trova al settimo piano e offre una splendida vista della citt√†, le parti comuni sono sofisticate ad eccezione dei corridoi delle camere che ho trovato troppo lugubri. La tecnologia regna sovrana, camere dotate di ipad con il quale comandi qualunque cosa, dalle luci, alle tende, alla tv e al servizio in camera. La nostra stanza si trovava al secondo piano con affaccio sulla chiesa di via Manzoni; ben insonorizzata, era spaziosa e con un bagno da favola e prodotti da bagno Armani. Minibar compreso, accappatoi di spugna, tutto per un soggiorno di lusso. Aggiungerei sky per completezza. Servizio sempre presente, in camera abbiamo trovato al nostro arrivo fragole e prosecco, e colazione ottima con buffet e piatti caldi da ordinare: pi√π che cibo sembravano piccole opere d'arte. Spa accogliente e con una bellissima vista sui tetti di Milano.Un hotel in cui impera il concetto che ""anche l'occhio vuole la sua parte"" con attenzione al dettaglio maniacale e un servizio sorridente che riesce a stemperare un'atmosfera altrimenti anche troppo alla moda."
303118536,July 2015,1.0,Worst travel experience.,"Booked a suite at the hotel for my honeymoon. Was pleasantly surprised with the iPad controlling the entire room, until it all broke down and went downhill from there. First night out in Milan, came back at 4AM to find everything not working from lights/TV/air conditioner. Called for assistance and the person did not even know what to do and said it was ""strange"" that this was happening until they did a complete reset at 4.30AM to get everything up and running. Next day same thing happened in the afternoon - spoke to the manager on duty and got moved to a bigger suite. Until the same thing happened again that same night while we were asleep and all the controls went off and I missed my flight the next morning as I was not able to open the safe and our passports were in there. Manager on duty came to the room to assist and acted like it wasn't a big deal. Well it was, and I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone visiting Milan. I've stayed in a lot of 5* hotels around the world and these sort of things do not happen in 5* hotels. Do yourself a favor and have a look at the other hotels around the Duomo. Lots of options around and you aren't missing out by not staying at the Armani Milano."
165696382,June 2013,2.0,Hotel bello ma servizio molto freddo e non all'altezza,"Ho soggiornato all'hotel Armani per una notte e, nel complesso, sono rimasto deluso.Al mio arrivo in taxi non c'era alcun membro del personale all'entrata, dunque prendo i bagagli, entro e si presenta una signorina che, credendo di essere spiritosa, mi dice ""qui per entrare bisogna dire una parola magica: aprire la porta"". Davvero incomprensibile. La stessa signorina, senza minimamente curarsi dei miei bagagli, mi conduce al primo piano alla reception, dove l‚Äôaccoglienza √® molto fredda e, per certi versi, inefficiente. La stessa signorina mi porta in stanza e tenta, goffamente, di mostrarmene le dotazioni tecnologiche: ma non riesce neppure a regolare l'aria condizionata (che era a 16 gradi!) e si giustifica dicendo che i clienti precedenti avevano chiesto di bloccare (sic!) l'aria condizionata di modo tale che non potesse essere regolata oltre i 21 gradi‚Ä¶.davvero mai sentito prima una cosa del genere. Due pasti con il room service: prezzo in linea con altri hotel della categoria a Milano (Park Hyatt, Bulgari), ma qualit√† decisamente inferiore...in particolare una pasta fatta in casa con astice e zucchine era assolutamente insipida.Semplici richieste del tipo asciugamani extra, borsa del ghiaccio etc. non vengono esaudite se non dopo reiterati solleciti...insomma un servizio a dir poco dilettantesco che diviene risibile per un hotel da quasi 1000 euro a notte!L'hotel, nel complesso, √® bello, certamente, ma molto freddo ed appesantito (il colmo per chi persegue il minimalismo!) da una tecnologia barocca, che si rivela scarsamente funzionale (pensate che nella stanza vi sono tende orizzontali e verticali, regolabili solo elettronicamente, ma non separatamente l'una dall'altra: o tutte aperte o tutte chiuse!).Non adatto a chi non vuole essere svegliato dalla luce del sole alle 6: ne entra in quantit√† industriale, nonostante il personale alla reception (rectius: lifestyle manager) dica diversamente e respinga la richiesta di un blackout alle finestre.Non ci torner√≤!"

The door-less interior design was pleasure to look at even though it needs a little swing to close it fully, and also iPad controlled multi functions were advanced. The hotel lobby services and greets in unison every single time you walk passed.Morning comes, the breakfast choices were alright. But,  unfortunately,  the services was not as attentive as I had expected. Waited 20 for my coffee,  I would blame that on the insufficient staff at the breakfast cafeteria. Otherwise, food's great.    Then two days flashes passed. After getting some last minute stuff, I had to get packing again. The guy on the ground floor,  Mr. Matthew,  was extremely patience and helpful,  whose English is excellent, in assisting in my packing and getting taxi to the airport.

They offered us an upgrade to a suite but found the balcony on the 6th floor worth the smaller room.  The lights and television are all programmed by iPad.  The mini-bar in the room is all complimentary and there is so much space for all of the new treats you will likely purchase here.  The staff are so attentive and speak good English. The bar is gorgeous and the bartenders really take care in making each one of their extensive list of creative, specialty cocktails.  We are in a wonderful area in Milan, close to all of the shopping, the Duomo and amazing restaurants.  Oh, and did I mention the Armani boutique is downstairs?  So is Nobu!

Unica milgioria da poter fare: entrata nella Spa non ho ricevuto alcun suggerimento su sauna e bagno turco.

Staff, das Geb√§ude, die Zimmer, das Design, die Einrichtung - einfach alles TOP. Ein pers√∂nlicher Lifestyle-Manager bem√ºht sich um den Gast, und erf√ºllt alle W√ºnsche (und wir haben nicht selten sehr ausgefallene W√ºnsche).Die Zimmer sind top eingerichtet, das Design von A bis Z durchdacht und aufeinander abgestimmt. Auch die Zimmergr√∂ssen sind f√ºr mail√§nder Verh√§ltnisse sehr gut (ab 50m2). Der Preis ist, verglichen mit anderen Hotels in Europa/USA/Mittlerer Osten) vertretbar, vor allem aber f√ºr mail√§nder Verh√§ltnisse gut.Zum Schluss noch ein Kommentar zu den negativen √Ñusserungen bez√ºglich Design und Ambiente anderer Kritiker: besucht man ein Armani Hotel, so sollte man nicht davon ausgehen, opulente, dekorverh√§ngte Zimmer im Louis XIV Stile vorzufinden. Tut man dies trotzdem, sollte man sich nicht √ºber das Design und die Architektur √§ussern.Ich habe mich nicht von den zum Teil (unangebrachten) negativen Kritiken nicht beeinflussen lassen - und dies hat sich ausbezahlt.

563717724,February 2018,1.0,Be VERY careful of your belongings....,"On a trip to Milan a few weeks ago, we spent a night at the Armani Hotel.  Some money - a significant amount - was stolen from our room. We unfortunately only realised after unpacking at our next location.Whilst the manager was responsive at the start, after I reported the matter to the police he seemed to suggest that it was our fault.  Perhaps we could have been more careful, but this does not excuse the behaviour of untrustworthy staff. Needless to say, we did not hear from him after our return home.    I would have expected a better level of follow up service from a well reputed establishment like this.   When we eventually called the Armani Hotel for an update ten days later, the manager suggested that we could tell our insurance company that we will take our business elsewhere if they were unhelpful.    I would apply the same attitude back to The Armani Hotel ‚Äì I will most definitely take my business elsewhere in the future."

Il personale alla reception √© gentilissimo e professionale. Le camere sono tutte bellissime se vi piace lo stile inconfondibile di Armani con i suoi materiali e le sue tinte tenui. Dotate di ogni confort, spaziose con tutti i servizi centralizzati in un supervisore demotico (laptop). Tra l'altro noi quest'anno abbiamo avuto una splendida sorpresa, un upgrade sulla nostra camera. Ci hanno assegnato una signature suite, semplicemente fantastica. La cena al ristorante √© stata stupenda, abbiamo mangiato davvero bene. Siamo poi stati nella lounge del bar Bomboo ed anche qui abbiamo trovato un atmosfera davvero unica.

I was expecting a light and airy interior and was initially surprised by the almost church like reserved colour pallet and minimal d√©cor - after a short while I totally fell in love with it ! - All staff were extremely polite - there was no pretention just courteous, attentive and sincere service. Being vegan I was a little concerned that food options could be limited, however the Bamboo Bar staff were genuinely delighted to help. Nothing was too much trouble. I am fortunate in having stayed in a significant number of 5 star hotels over the years - often with business travel - this one beats all other hands down. The spar is unique, with a Jacuzzi pool with panoramic views of the city. Interesting that the Armani brand is capable of extending its exceptional clothes ascetic to interior design AND service values. I slept over 9 hours one night which for me is almost unheard of - a good sign !We also visited the Armani Silos museum which similarly has my highest recommendation. Opera fans will love the fact that La Scala is only 3 minutes' walk away.  Dogs are also warmly welcomed which was great to see. Will definitely be back to stay when next in Milan.

346189254,January 2016,5.0,Impeccabile eleganza nella forma e nella sostanza,"L'Armani Hotel ha superato le nostre aspettative sotto ogni aspetto.A parte la posizione centralissima la struttura √® modernissima e di una raffinatezza quasi tangibile che pervade ogni angolo,dalla hall,a tutti gli spazi comuni,fino ad arrivare alla cortesia del personale sempre pronto a fornire con la massima disponibilit√† ragguagli,spiegazioni di ogni genere e cartine!E non si pu√≤ dire che non abbiamo avuto bisogno di supporto!A partire dall'ascensore che si aziona con una card sovrapposta ad un lettore apposito,nella stanza la domotica pi√π avanzata la fa decisamente da padrona,e non √® immediato orientarsi nei meandri avveniristici di tecnologie cos√¨ avanzate quando in casa si hanno ancora gli interruttori anni '60 e le lampadine che si avvitano!La nostra suite era superba e dotata di un ipad per gestire la zona living e di un altro ipad per la camera da letto.Una composizione di sei cioccolatini con la ""A""di Armani era solo il preludio di un ambiente dove tutto era elegantemente griffato senza cadere mai nel pacchiano.Faretti a profusione e stile minimal chic sui toni del bianco,nero,grigio argento,e diverse sfumature di beiges caldi e freddi,soprattutto nel bagno dalle dimensioni padronali: 2 lavandini,una vasca da bagno incastonata nel marmo e zona doccia e sanitari allestiti in due stanze parallele separate da vere e proprie porte.Molto sostanzioso il kit di cortesia in dotazione della toilette e davvero pratica l'idea di apporre un appendiabiti in bagno in aggiunta alla canonica cabina armadio.Direi sia inoltre l'unico albergo dove abbia mai soggiornato in cui il fornitissimo frigobar poteva essere gratuitamente ""saccheggiato""dagli ospiti.Ho usufruito del servizio in camera per colazione,che √® stato celere,come quando ho contattato la hall perch√© non riuscivo a capire come chiudere una finestra!La mia amica ed io ci siamo concesse anche un rigenerante e lunghissimo massaggio di 80 minuti nella blasonata spa all'ottavo piano con vista mozzafiato sulla citt√†  e non ci siamo private di un corroborante bagno nella piscina riscaldata, che troneggiava imponente in una silenziosa,vasta sala con lettini,riviste ed assortito angolo tisanerie.Con piacere spendo parole lusinghiere anche per la professionalit√† dei massaggiatori,capaci di individuare una contrattura con un solo tocco della mano.Molto gentilmente la direzione ci ha concesso un late ceck out di un'ora senza sovrapprezzo e finora l'Armani Hotel √® stato l'albergo di lusso di Milano,che maggiormente ha incrociato il mio gusto.La prossima volta vorrei provare anche il Bamboo bar e il ristorante stellato."

332442914,November 2015,4.0,Bellissima struttura,"L'Armani hotel √® sicuramente un'esperienza da provare, ad iniziare dalla sua struttura non classica della reception che non si trova all'ingresso dell'hotel. Ha tantissimi pregi tra cui la cura del dettaglio e la raffinatezza dello stile Armani che si nota in qualsiasi oggetto o pezzo d'arredamento. La SPA all'ultimo piano vale l'intero soggiorno. Unica nota critica (per questo no 5 pallini Tripadvisor) il personale in generale che non √® ancora all'altezza di un 5 stelle lusso, alcuni di loro sono perfetti ma altri devono ""studiare"" cosa sia un 5 stelle e la gestione dell'ospite. Il personale ed il management di un hotel devono essere scelti con criteri diversi da quelli di una boutique. Sono sicuro che nei prossimi mesi diventer√† una delle strutture di punta di Milano."

326485684,August 2015,5.0,Milan Style Defined,"I stayed here for a couple of nights in the summer. This is a seriously classy hotel. I loved everything. Perfect location in the fashion district but also for the centro storico (for which I mean the Duomo and the Castello really....). This hotel makes an immediate impact. Very good doormen and reception staff, classic Armani fragrance the minute you walk through the door fills your senses, wonderful classic lines and clean architecture. The rooms are a little dark and on the smaller side but go with it. They are ultra modern but so quiet and private. Everything controlled with the IPad. They have the best slippers and toiletries. I'm gushing I know! Sorry. One minor negative is that I really dislike a hotel where reception is not on the ground floor and is an elevator ride away. I got over this peeve though. I loved the Armani Bamboo Bar looking over the rooftops of Milano. This is a secret gem of a bar! For me, this is only comparable with one other hotel I've stayed in - the Upper House in Hong Kong. I intend to come back. Ci vediamo presto."

248451735,December 2014,3.0,Smelly Surprised,"Needless to say of the location,its a great excess, but,stepped into a lobby lounge with a strongly  smell of a dirty water was not a very sophisticated welcoming,and I thought,perhaps,its only because of a journey that sometimes make you feel out of your sense,but again ,after being lead to the room,was another unmistakably smell of a cheap disinfected in the corridor,am I in the wrong place?I mean...Being ArmaniThe personnal are not very professional compared to a 5stars standard,of course they do them best but only the best of what they know,they do urgently needed a real team of professional management.As it is,its seems like a B&B,and not even a good one,lack of class and professionality,its not enough the clean line of a uniformed or a Zen atmosphere,all personnal seems just a trainees,perhaps being an individual hotel its does give its  problem like many others hotels in Italy.The roomThe layout of the room may not be as elegant as armani cloths, even lifeless ,the furniture and the lightning are a bit too dark,the bathroom are the whole world apart and its absolutely meant to be for a beautiful peoples,even though its delivered its function Breakfast at the topThis is the best of the stayed,with a panoramic views of the city and a good selections of buffet,the food here is good as well as in the Bamboo bar which's the other corner of the room.In all,is not too bad a place,its just need  the right direction and its time, it could become an elegant,well groom,an well mature as Mr.Armani himself"

128613544,April 2012,1.0,What a disappointment!,"Well, it's like a fashion magazine when I've got inside, the lobby, the elevator, marble was everywhere, it makes the space amazingly glittered.But... it was cold, the service is over exagerating the ""marvelous"" cocktail, 20 minutes to make a tomate-mozarella when there is only 3 clients, and the bread is dry! ""I am sorry"" is all they can do for you.But when I saw the bill, I felt sorry for myself to be in such a joke.Don't waste you time, get inside, take some pictures, and get out!"
620892350,September 2018,4.0,"Chic Italian Sophistication, by Armani","This is the third hotel I have stayed in Milan, I have written reviews for Park Hyatt and Mandarin Oriental previously. This was also the first time I drove myself to the hotel rather than having a chauffeur service. The hotel is on a busy street so they have a small lay-by for maybe 2, max 3 cars, I was luck that it was not busy so we were able to pull up. The bell-hops were very quick at unloading my car and getting our bags and we went up to the lobby on the 7th floor. The interiors were ultra luxe, minimalist chic, well dressed staff and almost clinical corridors. We got checked in and was shown our room. The room was dark and modern, but it has some wear and tear. Carpet was old and almost looked dirty, some of the furnishings were chipped.The room was large and the bathroom was extremely spacious, for a deluxe double room. The closet configuration was a little disjointed, the space was too small to place bags inside, so we kept our luggage outside on racks. It was nice to have a complimentary mini bar so I did not have to be charged frivolously for consuming bottled water. The bed was very comfortable, but if you want to lie on it or want to get under the sheets, you will need to get a turndown service. They have a weird fitted shiny, vinyl-like cover and zipped pillow cover (see pic), a few minute job for room service to make the bed to allow it to be used. The Spa was nice, but the pool was little more than an oversized Jacuzzi, albeit it has an amazing view of the city compared to Mandarin, which was in the basement but that was a proper lap pool with day beds. The hotel would have better views if it did not have the louvers on the facade. Breakfast was very nice and the Bamboo Lounge (since the main restaurant is closed on Sundays) had great cocktails and food that was available was substantial. The staff were all excellent and friendly. I think if they did some minor renovations or upgrades of the carpet and furnishings, it will definitely help with their overall appearance. My only complaint will be that it was 65 euros for parking, almost 3 times the parking charges compared to the surrounding area parking garages and much more than other hotels. Regardless, all in all it was a great stay, I will just not bring a car the next time."
548414332,December 2017,5.0,the best,I've stayed in many wonderful hotels all around the world...this is my favorite for so many reasons.....Great location in a great city..Amazing buildingFantastic space.Wonderful Bar..But much more than anything else....Incredible high standard of personal service...We were so so looked after....From the moment we walked through the door...We felt like we were at home....I also think you get to know a hotel when something goes wrong...Milan In December. Its cold..and the heating in our suite wasn't working as good as it should have been.....The way we were treated the way the whole situation was handled was the best I have ever seen....On another occasion I left my phone in the back of a car that had returned us from the theatre.......The way they found my phone. Retrieved my phone and then returned it to me in a restaurant (while I was having dinner) in less than an hour ....was nothing short of amazing.....I wont mention names as that would be unfair....But thank you to each and every individual who works at The Armani Hotel in Milan.....You are a tribute to the name Armani and a tribute to the city of Milan....On behalf of Stacy and myself....Thank you...
528509473,September 2017,5.0,Silencio total,"Me hospedei por 2 noites na su√≠te cl√°ssica, e o que sempre me incomodou nos hot√©is foi o barulho (portas batendo, pessoas caminhando, vizinho conversando, carros na rua, etc) no Armani isso n√£o existe, voc√™ entra no seu quarto e n√£o escuta mais nada, isso para mim foi fant√°stico! O quarto √© de bom tamanho, pouco iluminado, banheiro incr√≠vel, enorme, um espa√ßo s√≥ para a ducha excelente, banheira maravilhosa, cama e travesseiros muito confort√°veis, os melhores da viagem (me hospedei em 9 hot√©is em setembro).

501456685,July 2017,5.0,Perfect for fans of luxury minimalism,"Location: Perfect if you are a shopaholic like me.  A simple 1 min walk to Via Monte Napoleone.  From there one can simply spend the whole day shopping and strolling merrily all the way to Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II and Duomo.  It's also right next to a subway station ( Montenapoleone).  There are also many nice restaurants and bars around.  First impression: The entry is understated.  Yet one simply can't miss it.  The Armani style pops up as soon as you see the sleek design of waiting area by the elevator.  The bellboy quickly took over my luggage and I was escorted up to the 7th floor for check in.  As soon as one steps out of the elevator, the floor length window and the venetian shutter brings out the Armani aesthetic at its best.  Check in:  Welcoming, painless, almost clinical. I was then personally escorted again down to my floor.  I was very impressed with the built-in doors to the wall.  No handles, clean and sleek.Room:  I checked in to the entry level deluxe room.  Anyone who ever tried to bargain-hunt for the cheapest room category in a luxury hotel just to say ""I've stayed there"" has their share of horror story about getting an odd room with no window/worst noise/right next to aircon unit or elevator...etc - you fill in the blank.  Well, not this one.  The room has floor length window facing the main street.  The room was dead quiet, not just ""considering its street-facing location and low-floor"", it was down-right dead quiet.  The room was very well designed and surprisingly spacious. The bathroom, which comes with a nice tub right by the window, his-and-her sink, and separate shower/toilet, was almost the same size as the generous bedroom.  Connecting the bathroom and the bathroom was closet and minibar area, which was fully stocked with snacks, soft drinks, juices, and coffee. No alcohol. But did I mention it's COMPLEMENTARY? I was especially pleased with its tablet control.  It was very user-friendly. One can do anything from turning on the bathroom light to asking for an extra dental kit (which was more than your average Colgate kit-it came with 2 tubes of Marvis tooth paste and tooth brush).Bathroom amenities:  It comes with all the standard-Armani body care range all the way.  Other facilities:  All the standard-free wifi, 24 hour gym, a relaxation pool that opens form 9AM to 9PM.  Complementary breakfast was served in one of the 2 restaurants on 7th floor-the restaurant itself was just so open and bright, one can't help but getting in a good mood to start the day.  The food was delicious, but nothing to write home about.  Bottom line:  If you are into old school glamour or homey feeling, this hotel is not for you.  Try Mandarin Oriental a few blocks down the road.  If you like luxury minimalism, you will appreciate the simple and sleek design that also pays great attention to details.  From the way the vestibule is placed at the room entry to mirrors that strategically placed in the  bathroom to optically brighten up the space, it was an experience, not just an overnight stay.  I was also impressed with how the hotel allowed me to be pampered while being self-sufficient at the same time. When other properties either suffocate you with attention or hang you out to dry, I felt right at home at Armani Milan."

480101010,April 2017,5.0,"Superb Location, Lovely rooms, Quirky touches and Great Service","Stayed here for a work trip with a colleague for 4 nights in April 2017. The week of the exhibition we were visiting the prices were 200% up but everywhere was in the city so value for money is hard to be realistic on that wee. If it was the week later I would say the normal price for this hotel is great value.GOOD POINTSLocation - is excellent, amazing roads near by, the Duomo near by, Shopping, Food, Bars and restaurants all within 5-10 minutes walk.Service -  in the hotel is superb, bar staff are excellent, reception staff , all restaurant staff and anyone we encountered.Food - excellent, fresh, quality and simple. Staff always on hand and in the bar throughout the day small antipasti and appetizers are served free which was a nice touch.Bar - on the new extension part built on top of the 5 story original building, superb views over the city and awesome tilting shades to let the light in throughout the day in different angles and shapes. Good staff and choice of exotic spirits.Nightclub - Armani Prive is downstairs, good night, packed, easy to get in when a hotel guest.Room - surprisingly big for a city hotel and with 2 of us sharing a room still plenty of space. All controlled by a touch pad, lighting, TV, AC, Blinds and service , even room service. Very well appointed and everything you need. Bathroom fully marble tiled, great big bath and huge rain shower. Free movies on the TV.BAD POINTS - None really only on this week the price was inflated due to the exhibition."
473384379,April 2017,5.0,"Timeless, Classic and Contemporary service and ambiance at every level.",Always a pleasure to stay at this hotel.

471789589,March 2017,5.0,Stylish and Elegant,"Armani is situated between in the fashion area and Brera district. There is even a metro next to it. So in terms of convenience, no other hotels can beat it. Furthermore, the human traffic is not high and one does not have to fight with many.As expected, service was great and impeccable. The guests were stylish and some were on heels that were pencil thin and adorn shades during breakfast. My room has a patio and it was nice to sit to chill during this spring weather. It had all the necessities and Armani is highly generous with their toiletries. There were adequate towels and pillows. Bed was firm and had good night sleep. The internet could have been better though.My only complaint was the TV console which is right in the middle of the room. It cuts the room very tightly and hard to move around. I'm a small built and so I cannot imagine a larger person. The room is activated through IPad. It can be quite bewildering if one is unfamiliar with technology. The entire hotel is activated through touch sensors and there have been a few occasions where I find myself having to keep pressing to activate lifts. Can be hilarious but at times, vexing."

399054763,July 2016,1.0,very bad experience!,"We stayed in Armani hotel on July 22 through July 26 2016 in room #506The hotel is in the good location and looks good and clean.The rooms are nice and very modern.                                                     everything in the room is controlled by an Ipad!Unfortunately we had some bad experience that we feel that future guests should know about!on our last night in the hotel the lights in the room lit up in the middle of the night every 30 minutes we has to get up every time to look for the Ipad and to program it to turn off the lights!!! how annoying!!! and of course  we barely slept that night!we called the reception couple of times and there was no answer!in the morning we went down and talked to the manager in charge Antonio and explained to him about what had happened and he told us to come back in 30 minutes to see how he can help and maybe accommodate us for our bad experience, so we went back to our room to pack and then we realized that my BOSE headphones were missing!we looked all over the room and we called the reception and notified them, they sent the house cleaning people to help us look for them and we could not find them!We came down again to talk to the manager and some other manager by the name of Francesco [--] talked to us, again we told him about our experience in the room with the lights and about the missing BOSE headphones and because we needed to run to the airport he gave us his business card and told us that they will check about our complains, we left our business card and he said he will contact us the next day, of course they did not contact us the next day so we called the hotel and talked to the manager Francesco [--] and asked him about our situation and he said that he can not disclose anything on the phone and that he will send us an email.We got the email from him! the email said that they had ""checked"" their cameras and nobody took our headphones and that we should look again in our hand luggage! How insulting!!!                                                                                       And that they brought in an ""engineer"" and there was nothing wrong with the lights! and therefor there is nothing that they can do for us!  if If we will come to the hotel in the future they will give us a room upgrade!!!wow!!!We feel this is a terrible way to handle a customer that spend well over $2000.00 for 4 nights in a place that suppose to be                                       a 5 star and top notch hotel.At Milan airport I purchased new BOSE headphones that Disappeared  for $430.00...ARMANI hotel=BAD EXPERIENCE"

Rooms are clean neat and spacious and the whole place just smellls soooo good. Bathroom was superb everything was just right. What more do you expect from an Armani Hotel?

Subito dopo il trattamento viso la mia pelle ha ritrovato luminosit√†, elasticit√† e compattezza, che a causa dello smog e dello stress quotidiano aveva perso.Ci torner√≤ sicuramente e lo consiglio a tutti, anche a quelli che si lamentano di avere poco tempo, perch√© una pausa alla Spa Armani √® un piacere impagabile!

Its Milan!). The hotel is a true icon to Armani, elegant spaces and rooms. You are most likely to find someone famous there. The service is excellent, as well as the food, and if you are in the mood for japanese, the Nobu is next to the hotel. Being a true fan of Armani hotels, it does lack a little luxury in comparison to the one in Burj Khalifa, still it serves to be the best hotel to stay in Milan."

Hospedar no Armani foi uma grande decep√ß√£o por v√°rios motivos:- teoricamente,o hotel deve hospedar p√∫blico ligado √† moda,principalmente mulheres.Entretanto esqueceram que precisamos de luz pra nos maquiar.O quarto √© extremamente escuro sem possibilidade de melhora qualidade luz.-a decora√ß√£o do hotel inexiste!  Um bloco de metais, sem flores ou qualquer ornamento que nos traga aconchego.Uma estrutura de laminados n√£o basta para hospedar.Voc√™ n√£o se sente acolhido nenhum momento. Nao basta ter aquecimento de paredes,seria mais importante um aquecimento de cora√ß√µes  e mentes.O hotel seria no m√°ximo 3 estrelas. -Voc√™ gosta de mimos?Esque√ßa! Nada de delicadezas ou chocolates de boa noite. Detalhe: ao lado do hotel tem uma chocolaterie e floricultura Armani.-o frigobar que √© gratuito √© uma vergonha!Qualidade ruim para que voc√™ n√£o  consuma nada.-servi√ßo de quarto: p√©ssimo.  Caso voc√™ n√£o conhe√ßa culin√°ria italiana,voc√™ ter√° impress√£o que a massa italiana √© horr√≠vel! O card√°pio oferecido √© p√©ssimo! A massa de qualidade ruim e feita de forma grosseira! Sabor de comida microondas.-n√£o pe√ßa caf√© manh√£ no quarto!Qualidade baix√≠ssima e pre√ßo exorbitante!-o restaurante Nobu √© ao lado do hotel. E se dizem parceiros.Entretanto n√£o tem possibilidade de entrega refei√ß√£o no Armani. Em outros hot√©is isso acontece para melhor atendimento do cliente. Resumindo,temos sensa√ß√£o que o Sr. Armani somente cedeu seu nome ao empreendimento. A satisfa√ß√£o do cliente est√° em √∫ltimo plano.Hospedar bem est√° longe disso! Precisamos nos sentir acolhidos e bem recebidos pela institui√ß√£o. O valor da di√°ria n√£o condiz com servi√ßo prestado pelo hotel. Frio,impessoal,distante e vazio!Completa decep√ß√£o!"
264007564,April 2015,5.0,Absolut empfehlenswert!,"Wir waren √ºber die Osterfeiertage zu Gast im Armani Hotel Milano und waren mehr als zufrieden mit unserem Aufenthalt. Die Lage des Hotels ist sch√∂n und ruhig, ob Duomo, Restaurants oder sonstige ""wichtige"" Shoppingstra√üen, alles in unmittelbarer N√§he. Auch das bekannte Sushi Restaurant Nobu ist ums Eck. Das Hotel √ºberzeugt aber vor allem auch durch seine Architektur und das Design der Zimmer, wirklich beeindruckend wie alles bis ins kleinste Detail designt ist. Besonders das Badezimmer ist riesig und s√§mtliche Einstellungen wie Licht und Jalousien lassen sich √ºber ein iPad steuern. Zudem war das Zustellbett in unserem Zimmer f√ºr unsere Tochter sehr komfortabel...da haben wir schon anderes erlebt...Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Einziges Manko ist aber, dass unsere Minibar (Service inklusive) nicht wiederaufgef√ºllt wurde. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist f√ºr ein italienisches Fr√ºhst√ºck √ºberdurchschnittlich gut und qualitativ hochwertig. Wie gesagt, wir waren mit dem Armani Hotel rundum zufrieden und beeindruckt und k√∂nnen es nur weiter empfehlen. Trotz der Preise jeden Cent wert."

They have no idea how to make a guest feel comfortable. They are too relaxed for a 5* hotel staff.I have been trying to reach the room service by phone (wanted to have some water in the room) for 10 minutes, but no one replied! I had to go upstairs to repection in order to be serviced.Then when checking out, we had to wait for 20 minutes to be serviced, because there was only one girl at the reception, and then....suddenly!!!...three other people from staff have appeared! Why can't they follow what is happening at reception? It seems that they did not have many people staying at the hotel...In addition, despite thick windows, we heard all the trams passing by the street, which was quite annoying, especially in the evening..."
186614562,December 2013,3.0,"There are so many magnificent Hotels in Milan, why would anyone EVER choose Armani?","I live in Milan for over 5 years, so I consider myself almost local here now.I know most of the hotels in Milan and stayed in most of them. I stayed in Armani this week since my friends were visiting and wanted to have this experience. I did not convince them otherwise, since a guest at Bamboo bar many times I never stayed in the hotel itself previously and wanted to try it.Very familiar with Armani style one should expect infamous 'greige' color everywhere and a minimalistic style. Of course it's a matter of personal opinion but I believe in the hotel itself it is bizzardly overboard and depressing. Elevators only work with the use of the magnetic room key, mine refused to cooperate for some minutes and I was closed in one of the elevators without moving anywhere till I pressed on door open button and tried the exsercise all over again. After a check in in the lobby, you are taken in a limitedly litten corridor which seems endless and astonishingly identical all the way through to your room. The best way to describe it (came to my mind while walking) was a corridor of an underground garage, from cement where each door seems to be a car storage. In the room the situation in terms of light or setting did not improve much.The bathroom was enourmos and somehow bigger then the room which was quite odd. The heat for some strange reasonable was very high, and the rest of our stay we battled with it. We tried to lower it with remote control, called reception numerous times trying to u understand what is it we are doing wrong. The end result was-we opened the window for a bit, but then had to close it since it was really cold outside those days. Opening a window was a challenge. During the night it was unbearably hot, we couldn't sleep I had no cover on and woke up with a distinct feeling of having crossed the desert. Drank 3 bottles of water during the process. Room is minimalistic in style, gray and black everywhere, strange amount of doors with no handles, door to the room, isolation door, doors to closets, doors to bathroom, shower, corridor in between, by door 3 it starts to bug you, even if you have figured out a way to open them. I constantly fell like I am doing a crossword puzzle between doors, switches, elevators, exiting the room and finding the elevators in identical dark halls, and heat. Additionally an astonishing thing (maybe we did not figure something out but...) was the pillows on the bed. They all seemed to be for decoration and none for sleeping. The ones that seemed the sleeping type judging by the size were dressed in the strangest very rough fabric almost like trench but worse, that I could not possibly put my face on. For a while I thought maybe other pillows are hidden somewhere, but no, we called the reception again and they did not advice us on the wearbouts of the other pillows and offered to bring new ones. After which they were not delivered for more then half hour. I called back again to see if they were on their way and finally they appeared.When I read trip advisors reviews after my stay, and some individuals continue to talk of 'experience' I had a slight doubt that possibly they worked for the brand. Overall feeling at the check out: you have been visiting and staying in a very luxury jail and you are released. CONCLUSION: On the positive note: great bed, bed sheets, and new pillows, good view from the room, moderately pleasant staff, great location. On the negative: unless you adore crossword puzzles and grey color everywhere, and unless the hotel is covered by your company, you can find so many amazing alternatives with the same location and same or better view. Some of the suggestions are: Grand Hotel Milan (next door, we ended up moving there for the reason of the heat), Bulgari Hotel, Principe de Savoy, 4 Seasons."

137823283,August 2012,4.0,Super Swank!,"The Armani Milan is the second property of the Armani hotel chain after their Dubai property. Opened for less than a year, the Armani Milano is already generating a lot of buzz online and thru travel publications but has managed to keep a low profile so far, despite already being regarded as a top notch luxury property. I originally booked the Armani for my 2 nights stay in Milan, then decided to cancel it because of some of the horror stories reviews in Tripadvisor and changed to the Four Seasons instead. I booked the hotel again after a short tour of the hotel room courtesy of the friendly sales staff, I was sufficiently impressed to decide to move in and try one night on the spot. The hotel was just a short walk away at Via Manzoni making the shift easy. So I checked out from the disappointing Four Seasons and move in to the Armani instead. ArrivingAs I already per-reserved the room, I was able to check in swiftly. A frontdesk staff escorted me to the room and explained the features, especially the remote which controls all the function in the room. The RoomI booked a Premier room. The room categories are deluxe (standard), premier, classic suite, executive suite, signature suites and presidential suite. For a solo traveler, the Premier Room is the best room type as it is relatively spacious compared to the standard room ( 55m2 vs 45m2 ) but the rates are competitively priced. If you need the additional closet space or sitting area, go for the larger suite but that in my opinion, this is not value for money, as you will be paying for twice the rate for a larger sitting area while the in-room amenities and bathroom are all the same.The room is of course decorated in stylish signature Armani style. It‚Äôs looks closely resembles that of Armani Dubai. Everything is super luxurious and comfortable. The furniture were either specially chosen or custom made, with a lot of care and they are without exception superbly furnished and of very high quality. Armani's own furniture line, the Armani casa inspired the furniture design in this hotel. I was also told each room is personally supervised by Mr Armani himself on the final touches and furnishing, and this is evident in the phenomenal attention to detail.  Upon entering the room, one is greeted by a circular foyer, which has a door that can be closed for privacy. My premier room comes with a credenza that house the TV, which automatically rises up when you turn it on with the remote, and sink back into the credensa when turn off. Very cool. There‚Äôs a large king size bed which is supremely comfortable and decked out in some of the most sumptuous linens I have slept in. The bathroom is gorgeous, in natural limestone marble and modern fittings. There‚Äôs also rain-shower and a large soaking tub. The bathrobes and towels are large, soft and fluffy and absolutely delightful. Armani own branded bath amenities provided. About the only thing missing is the bathroom TV.  The room is very high-tech. There‚Äôs a universal remote that control all functions of the room, including operating the entertainment system, open/close window binds, adjust the climate control, adjust the lighting in the room, turn on the Do-Not-Disturb sign and even alert you when someone is at the door. Amazing. I was expecting that it could also be used to flush the toilet. No, that didn‚Äôt work. Oh well, that was asking too much. The room was whisper quiet during my stay, which was a great relief. Internet speed was reasonably fast and is free and available in both the room and the common areas. The Entertainment system is very cool. From the TV menu, you can select to explore the facilities of the hotel, choose a song or CD, play back internet radio, buy a movie or select a TV channel, all in a sleek Armani interface. I have to think hard to find nit-picks to complaints, and there are some. The universal remote, while very cool is a bit quirky and at times stop working. When that happened however, a technician was on hand to solve the problem. The TV rising from the cabinet is cool, but it is only watchable from the bed and not from the sitting sofa because it cannot be turned, a really careless omission. Wonder how they can miss that. There‚Äôs also no iPod dock, despite what was advertised in the hotel‚Äôs website. Each room is supposed to come with a butler or as Armani call them, lifestyle managers. I didn‚Äôt meet my lifestyle manager nor was I aware who he or she was. However, as I had no problems getting service, I did not thought much about it. There‚Äôs only one plug next to the work desk, which is not sufficient for tech-savy modern traveler like myself. Overall, this is an excellent hotel room, superbly furnished, sumptuously luxurious and supremely comfortable. However, it has to be said that the high-tech touch and utra-modern styling might not appeal to everyone‚Äôs taste. The common areasThe Armani hotel is housed in a renovated tower that also housed the Armani store and the Armani caf√© and boutiques, all of which are closed for the Summer holidays. Even the hotel‚Äôs own restaurant was closed which was disappointing, as the only option for meal is room service or at the bamboo bar. The entrance is also the arrival lobby, and the actually lobby is at the 7th floor. The Spa and Gym / Fitness centre is located on the 8th floor. The pool is rather small but has a 360Deg view of Milan city at a vantage point. I had breakfast at the hotel and the quality was very good. There‚Äôs a buffet selection for the cold items such as bakery, fruits and salmon and a made-to-order ala carte selection. The hotel is located in the Via Mazoni area and within short walking distance to the Doumo and the La Scalla so it is near to many restaurants and boutique shops. Too bad almost all of them were closed for the summer holidays. ServiceService is by and large attentive and efficient. However, things are not that instant and there is some waiting time involved for service request. I find the service at the morning breakfast in particular to be very attentive. I was up early and the only person at the restaurant might explain that. As everywhere is closed, I had a simple meal at the Bamboo bar which is an orange juice, a cheese burger, a rose champaign and a cr√®me bulee dessert for a reasonable 74 Euros, while I admire the sunset view from the bar. One service issue I noticed during my stay is that the reception desk whom the staff also double as concierge is always very busy. Perhaps because of summer holidays, it is also short-handed and there is waiting time involved. A separate concierge desk or just having three staff manning the front desk will be helpful. ConclusionYes, I love this hotel. Any reservations I had earlier about poor service or lack of standards were thrown out of the window and despite being under-staff, the hotel still managed to deliver reasonably good service during my stay. The rooms are the highlight of the hotel, luxurious, exemplary, super-swank in Armani style. The comfort factor is very high and it was overall a great stay. I will rate it 4/5 due to some minor issues as mentioned in the review, but this I think is currently the best hotel in Milan."

559925137,February 2018,5.0,A very special birthday indeed,"My second visit to the Armani Hotel in Milan. I love it here, if find the ambiance very relaxing, it quietens my busy mind and inspires me in many ways - opening me to a new perspective on aesthetics and culinary experiences. I had a big birthday during my visit, friends who joined me here told the staff and to my surprise I found a cake in my room one evening after dinner, not easy given that I am vegan - what a wonderful surprise and very touching. The spa and gym which I used every day, are wonderful as are the staff who seem to genuinely enjoy working here, their greetings are sincere and their smiles are genuine. Thank you for a wonderful few days, I am already looking forward to my next visit."
552925671,January 2018,2.0,Like a broken down Ferrari,"We were very excited about staying here all the reviews are great, the location, and we planned on going to Armani Prive for NYE.  The room on the face of it was nice, but attention to detail made me think has this hotel run out of money, are they blind, or don‚Äôt they care?  The Hotel itself is nice, except all the different components work almost against each other opposed to in harmony.We wanted to go to Armani Prive for NYE so the Hotel Lifestyle team assisted the best they could, but said it is completely different and separate from the Hotel.  Then they came back with expensive table packages.  Since we were running out of time we confirmed we would take one.  A few hours later they had all gone except a few and as a result the tables had more than doubled heading towards ‚Ç¨1,000 for a table!  In the end we paid ‚Ç¨100 each to get in and get one complimentary drink.  We sat at the bar and had a great time.  The club is cool and bar staff friendly and attentive.  The seats we had were far superior to those of some of the tables as they were low down and in the corner where you can‚Äôt see anything going on.The photographs show what I am trying to say regarding the hotel.  Mould/stained sealant in the shower, cracked sink, loose tiles, chunks missing from tiles, patched up curtain..... not what I was expecting for the money, never mind from Armani."
551248924,November 2017,5.0,The wonderful Armani Hotel Milano,We stayed in an Executive Suite. The room was just beautiful and had a very modern technology system. The whole room is controlled from an iPad. It had two bathrooms (one master bathroom and one guest bathroom). And two rooms - a living room and a bedroom. There was an entry foyer as well. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel's bar and restaurant were purely amazing. The food was delicious and there were many choices. Would love to stay here again. The hotel also features a gym and a jacuzzi. The views over the city were wonderful.
550187480,December 2017,5.0,Ultra chic hotel,"We stayed here during our 2 night visit to milan.  The location is great.  Couldn't ask for anything better.   Close by all the main shopping stores.  Staff was fabulous friendly and willing to assist with any needs and recommendations.  When you get off the elevator to your floor I loved that you didn't feel like you were staying in a hotel.  Each room door just blended in with walls you couldn't  even tell they were there.  One of my fav features.  The attention to detail when designing this hotel is superb!   The room is controlled by the iPad. If you are jet lagged the black out shades will make the room pitch dark to help you get your rest.  Another fav feature is the heated floors in the bathroom.  So so nice especially in the cold months when you get up in the middle of the night.  At nighttime  I noticed our shower water would get very hot then cool then go back to the temp it was on.  Kinda bizarre.  Heated towel racks will keep your towels warm.   Beds were super comfy and great quality of linens.   Brought a bottle of champagne back to the room.  Nice that the room was equipped w 2 glass AH champagne glasses.  We ordered room service both mornings.   It came to $50 Euro per person for 1 breakfast omelette.   Kind of steep to me.  There were a number of sides that came with it like a basket of breads, yogurt, fruit etc that we just split 1 breakfast between the 2 of us.  Yes you have to take the elevator from your room floor to the lobby floor then transfer elevators.  We did not mind the transfer.  Over all I highly recommend and we would return to this hotel.  Must check to see where else his hotels are!   A+++"
548615364,November 2017,5.0,World class service!,"We only stayed in Milano for a day but this hotel made the perfect end of our trip in Italy. The quality of the bed, the linen, the design, the variety of the breakfast and the honest smiles from the reception desk made this hotel one of the best hotel experience we ever had! Located at the best spot in Milan! Surely recommended"

Did not like the rather dim lighting in corridors and room. The bed and pillows were less comfortable than expected."
514134456,August 2017,4.0,Very nice,"We stayed in this hotel during the month of August and had two rooms 206 and 203. Actually, this was the 2nd time in the hotel and again it was very lovely and in a perfect location. Personnel are very friendly and very accommodating. The reason for the 4 star was because the rooms were very dusty and not being cleaned properly. We had a coffee stain on our bed sheet that housekeeping had not changed. When I called to complain the attention was excellent the manager came to the room apologized and then sent a bottle of champagne which was very nice of them and not expected at all. Overall the hotel is lovely."

Food is served so elegantly.Not sure it's a great place for young kids, but a superb one for couples and business ppl."
483619150,April 2017,3.0,"Muy buen hotel, pero mejorable en detalles.","Excelente ubicaci√≥n y amabilidad de todo el personal;rapidez en el check-in y el check-out; atenci√≥n muy correcta y discreta, suites ampl√≠simas y muy silenciosas que convert√≠an el descanso en una experiencia muy placentera.Todas las luces y servicios de la habitaci√≥n, manejables a trav√©s de ipad muy f√°cil de manejar y comod√≠simo de utilizar.....Pero hay cosas que no me gustaron, una de ellas, inevitable por la propia estructura del hotel: la llegada a tu habitaci√≥n requer√≠a un ""trasbordo"" de ascensor, al estar situada la recepci√≥n en la s√©ptima planta y tener luego que coger otro para descender a donde estuviera tu suite; las otras dos, s√≠ que eran evitables: a veces se olvidaban de retirar los servicios usados del mini bar (gratuito, por cierto), y te encontrabas con botellas vac√≠as al volver. Al abandonar el hotel, no s√© porque extra√±a raz√≥n, hube de pagar 50 euros (cinco por noche), que te cobran en concepto de no s√© que (ni me molest√© en preguntarlo). Y , por ultimo, olvid√© algo en la habitaci√≥n, mand√© un e-mail al hotel para que me lo recogieran, y aun sigo esperando respuesta. Estos peque√±os detalles hacen que no ponga un diez a este, por otra parte, excelente hotel, que recomiendo a todos. (estaci√≥n de metro de Montelapoleone en la misma puerta, otra ventaja)."

464014942,February 2017,2.0,Mixed feelings,"Rooms were nice though abit too dark for our liking.Our package included breakfast which was not bad.The not so good - the staff at reception were frosty. it was a cold reception and it was not a great way to start our holiday in Milan. Housekeeping was alright but there was one housekeeper who came into our room twice without knocking - she was cleaning the room when we came back and she left to get stuff but came back in without knocking or ringing the door bell. Overall the impression was that while the hotel is branded, the service needs polish. We felt quite taken aback by the snooty staff that we didn't want to buy anything Armani at all. We didn't want to spend a cent more than we already had at Armani.Conversely, after we stayed at the Ferragamo hotel in Rome, the service and experience was so good that we are now fans of both the hotel and the Ferragamo brand."

461304984,February 2017,5.0,Classy and luxurious hotel in Milan,"It's my first time staying at a fashion designer hotel and the Armani Milano did not disappoint.  I booked into a deluxe room and got upgraded two grades up to a suite which was about 65 sq feet.  Very private, comfortable, and all the room's control can be done via an iPad, which was easy to use.Bed was very comfortable.  Bathroom is warmer than the rest of the room on purpose, and has big bath and good rain shower with good pressure.  Furnishing of the room is classy, modern, the room can be abit dark to some by I find it nice.  Every light is dimmable.Breakfast is fair, good selection of cold cuts fruits and yogurt.  Not impressive though and could be better for a hotel of similar grade.The spa and gym is one of the highlights of the hotel.  Jacuzzi, steam and sauna is shared by ladies and gents, but there are 4 booths for steam and sauna where you can enjoy by yourself or with your other half.  I didn't do a treatment but it seems busy and should be quite popular.  Only real complaint is the doormen, which sometimes gone MIA.  As the lobby is on 7/F and the entrance is on GF, it gives an image that the hotel is understaffed.  The lobby check in and concierge staff are good though.  Overall it is a good place to stay in Milan and represents good value, as I believe their rate is cheaper than park Hyatt or 4 seasons but the hardware is similar to them."
461099817,February 2017,5.0,Finalmente un terapista preparato,"Io e mia moglie appena possiamo ci riserviamo un weekend in una spa. Siamo stati al Boscolo, al Four season, al Mandarin e all Armani per menzionare quelli di Milano.All Armani siamo ritornati questo weekend perch√© volevamo anche provare le camere dell albergo che ci hanno stupito per il confort e la cura dei dettagli.La Spa dell Armani √® una conferma per la bellezza, il servizio e il confort.Devo segnalare il terapista di questo sabato: Fabrizio.Oltre a farmi rilassare mi ha consigliato e fatto fare degli esercizi per decontrarre la schiena e gli arti.La struttura si valuta soprattutto per le persone che riesce ad integrare all interno.Ho provato anche il bar dell Armani, modaiolo, ben frequentato ma comunque attento a tutto, anche al latte di nostra figlia.Insieme a 2 cocktail abbiamo chiesto se fosse possibile avere del latte per nostra figlia di un anno e ci hanno accontentato.Ci manca da provare solo il ristorante.Per ora uno dei migliori alberghi al mondo che abbia mai provato.Forse non il pi√π bello ma uno dei pi√π attenti."
456835416,January 2017,4.0,Nice hotel,"La posizione dell'hotel e' molto buona. A 30 metri dall'inizio di via montenapoleone. La camera e' molto funzionale e connessa in tutte le sue funzioni tramite degi Ipad che sono installati nella camera. Quindi luci, tende, tv, aircon, servizio in camera sono controllabili in remoto. Mi e' piaciuto molto l'arredamento. La camera era ben decorata. Ho preso la suite e non mi e' dispiaciuta essendo pero' un articolo di review vorrei sottolineare due aspetti che non mi sono piaciuti. La camera e' ad un piano inferiore alla lobby, se non ricordo male al 7. La suite si estende in lunghezza, quindi come un tunnel stretto che da una sensazione di ambiente claustrofobico. I metri quadrati sicuramente sono negli standard ma l'organizzazione in cui e' organizzata la camera non danno la sensazione di ampiezza che una suite dovrebbe dare a differenza di una standard or executive room, la  camera resto tuttavia per arredamento e confort ottima.Peccato invece per il servizio. Dall Ipad puoi prenotare il tavolo al ristorante e chiedere il servizio di servizio in camera.Al ristorante non sapevano della mia prenotazione e ho dovuto chiamare per il servizio in camera via telefono."

444925672,December 2016,4.0,carino,"Hotel molto comodo per spostarsi in centro.  Molto scomodo invece strutturalmente: bisogna prendere la mano per capire come arrivare al piano terra, perch√© in ogni caso si deve sempre passare per il piano dove c'√® il ricevimento. Stanza molto bella, letto comodissimo, e comfort vari molto apprezzati. Ho trovato di una scomodit√† unica tutto il sistema di gestione della stanza tramite un tablet... una sorta di domotica semza senso. Svegliarsi di notte x andare in bagno e dover cercare il tablet per accendere la luce... anche no.Abbiamo anche avuto un problema di non so che tipo per cui le luci andavano da sole. Il bagno bellissimo composto da due ambienti molto ""spa"".Una menzione negativa a parte per la colazione  (non inclusa nella stanza). Una colazione davvero dozzinale, scelta misera e servizio non all'altezza. Hanno dei prodotti di qualit√† medio bassa e mal presentati.Non fate la colazione qui."
444807210,November 2016,5.0,Il lusso secondo Armani..,"Ambiente e design ..tutto parla di Giorgio Armani icona di stile ed eleganza che sono espressamente riportate nel suo omonimo hotel nella sua Milano , una Milano dal lusso glamour che qui dentro ancora vive grazie anche ai suoi ospiti internazionali e ad uno staff preparato  e cortese  . Bellissima la camera al top del confort con il pad controller e mini bar incluso , colazione eccellente e ricca di qualita' , palestra con vista sui tetti del centro . Spa con piscina che colmcalar del buio diventa un ambiente intimo e di relax . Abbiamo avuto un piccolo disguido con il trattamento prescelto ma la cortesia dello staff e della manager hanno fatto la differenza e non ha inificiato affatto l esperienza complessiva . Location perfetta per shopping e visite d arte."
443723506,December 2016,3.0,Pensavo meglio!!,"Ho scelto l'Armani Hotel perch√© situato in centro e visto che mi sono recata questo fine settimana per gli acquisti natalizi, mi √© sembrato l'ideale. La struttura √® molto moderna, tutta la camera √© controllata da iPad a tua disposizione, che a volte per√≤ risulta un po' scomodo. un interruttore per la luce sarebbe stato apprezzato. La camera, noi abbiamo scelto una suite, era arredata con mobili molto sobri e datati, per il prezzo mi aspettavo di pi√π. La stanza da bagno invece √© paragonabile ad un mini appartamento, ampia, spaziosa e arredata con gusto. Peccato che il riscaldamento si attiva solo al tuo arrivo e quindi la camera risulta fredda appena entri, ed essendo in pieno dicembre avrei preferito trovarla gi√† calda e questo lo trovo un grande disguido. Le 5 stelle sono da attribuire al servizio, tutto il personale √© servizievole, gentilissimo ed nei limiti del possibile esaudiscono i tuoi desideri e ti coccolano. Peccato, speravo che con questo prezzo sarei rimasta pi√π soddisfatta."

431168092,October 2016,4.0,Wie immer ausgezeichnet. Mailands beste Adresse,"Das Armani ist und bleibt unsere Lieblingsadresse in Mailand.Auch unser dritter Aufenthalt war wie immer sehr sch√∂n. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist und bleibt eines der besten weltweit und besonders in Mailand. Eierspeisen und sonstiger Schnickschnack kostet extra, was vielleicht ein Minuspunkt sein mag. Andererseits ist das Buffet qualitativ sehr hochwertig und bietet alles was das Herz begehrt. Leider ist das Personal etwas √ºberfordert, wenn das Hotel gut besucht ist und der Kaffee l√§sst somit etwas l√§nger auf sich warten.Ein St√∂rfaktor war, dass in unserer Suite im G√§stebadezimmer kein warmes Wasser lief. Allerdings wurde das Problem vom Personal umgehend behoben bzw. ein Teil ausgetauscht. Zudem funktionierten die Zimmerkarten nicht ganz problemlos, was ebenfalls etwas nervig war, da man st√§ndig die Rezeption aufsuchen musste.Trotz der Kleinigkeiten war es wieder ein sehr angenehmer und wie immer luxuri√∂ser Aufenthalt im Armani Hotel. Das Hotel- und Zimmerdesign, Fr√ºhst√ºck und die exzellente Lage direkt bei der Via Montenapoleone kann kein Hotel in Mailand toppen. Gerne wieder."
429825956,October 2016,5.0,Che meraviglia!,"Meravigliosa esperienza! Gli ambienti eleganti ma non sfarzosi creano una bellissima atmosfera, moderna e accogliente al tempo stesso. Il personale √® delizioso, discreto e affabile. La vista dal piano alto √® mozzafiato e val la pena trascorrerci una serata anche solo per un aperitivo. Assolutamente consigliato."
428974792,October 2016,5.0,Stunning but......,"We stayed here for four nights and were very pleasantly surprised when we checked in early in the morning, several hours before the official check-in,  to be told that we were going to be upgraded to the sixth floor with a room which had a balcony.  For sure, if you have the chance, the sixth floor rooms with balconies are truly superbt, offering magnificent views across the city.   Only rooms on the sixth floor have balconies.I have to say that the thing that impressed us the most about the hotel was the warmth and personal attention of the staff.  They truly went out of their way to make you feel welcome and very soon recognised you by sight and name.There were a few things though in the design of the hotel common areas and the room where we felt that form had overtaken function.  This is not to say that the hotel common areas and the room were not impressive, because they were.  For example, trying to find the bathrooms located near the public area.  The signage both as to the location and which was the gents and which were the ladies, was just simply far too subtle for us.  When I first eventually found the toilet entrance doors, I thought they were emergency exit doors because of what appeared to be the large horizontal emergency release bar, which where I come from, is only used on emergency exits.  That is in fact the handle that you use to open the door.  The bathroom itself was also a bit on the dark side and the basket for collecting the used hand towels was clearly an afterthought, as it obstructed one of the hand basins.  In the bedroom itself the lighting and room controls are extremely discreet and so subtle that you can easily miss them.  We understand this has been improved recently by the introduction of an iPad which controls everything in the room,  including lighting, air conditioning, blinds, TV etc, etc.  This is undoubtedly an improvement, but I could not find out how to leave on a nightlight.  The bathroom was very large and very pleasant.  It is however impossible to distinguish between the door for the shower and the door for the toilet and for the first day or so, this takes a little bit of getting used to.  The shower cubicle was very large but a little dark inside, even with the light built into the rainforest shower switched on.  This meant that the extremely subtle marking on the shower controls to distinguish hot and cold and the control between the various shower outlets, are just about impossible to read, especially if you need to wear glasses.Personally, if I was designing the bathroom, I would have orientated the bath arrangement so that you faced the beautiful view out through the window, rather than had your back to it, when sat in the bath.Hand basins for two, rather than one could probably have been included in the bathroom design, with a little bit of space rearrangement.I think it's very important to make it quite clear that compared to the design pluses that are too numerous to list (just for example, the excellent walk-in wardrobe/dressing room;  the excellent and complimentary minibar;  a superbly comfortable bed)  the above critical points are minor  and did not ruin our stay in any way.  Nonetheless they were points that we noted and remembered a few weeks after we had left.The location of the hotel is absolutely superb.  We were able to walk to just about everywhere that we wish to go to.  There is a and underground railway entrance next door to the hotel, a tram stop outside the hotel and all of the top shopping streets and areas are within easy walking distance, as are many excellent restaurants and tourist sites.   We were impressed by the Armani Hotel in many ways, as we were impressed by Milan which we had not been to before.  We intend to return."
428184931,October 2016,5.0,A perfect Armani desigh,Stayed one night. Delux room was well designed with huge walkin shower and nice bathroom. Very comfortable bed. Dining room service was quick and elegant with delicious risotto and burata salad. Elegant dining room for breakfast and nice choice with fresh products. Great spa.
424655115,September 2016,4.0,trendy hotel,"Great location, trendy hotel, lovely bedroom with amazing bathroom BUT very noisy: we could hear everything in the room next to us (snoring, conversation, tv......) which is a real shame as it completely ruined our stay. We will choose another hotel next time because of that. The breakfast wasn't very good either. We also found that the change of lift to access the bedrooms was inconvenient (you have to take a lift from the entrance on the ground floor to access the lobby on the 6th floor then take another lift to the rooms.) Considering the choice on of 5 star hotels in the same area we will try another one next time."

362636990,April 2016,5.0,Staff that makes it magical,"We walked in and suddenly got confused by the dearth of a reception. But that's where the world of Maestro Giorgio began because we were rapidly approached by a nice doorman who showed us the way to the lobby. Once there, we were professionally and smartly welcomed by the Lifestyle Manager Francesco who instantly looked after every single aspect of our stay and provided us all the information we needed about restaurants, tours, museums and clubs. The check in was a flash, the room was amazing (exactly what you expect when you say Armani Hotel) the restaurant was extraordinary and the food insanely good.WELL DONE!"

Die Bar hat uns auch gut gefallen, wobei das Fr√ºhst√ºck schon fast sch√∂ner war, von der Aussicht und der Vielfalt. Das Personal, wie immer auf diesem Standard, erstklassig. Der Spa Bereich war klein aber fein. Das Duschmittel, sowie Shampoo riecht exquisit, halt Armani... love it! Auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert, jedoch nicht gerade g√ºnstig."

The staff are lovely and so attentive, friendly smiley personnel that makes you fell comfort and important at the same time.                                                                                                                                   This time the food was amazing on a Food Michelin star level restaurant and we was there for the delicious Easter Brunch . The Bar was surrounded of cool and nice Milano and international people , a real stylish place and fun at the same time, we love aperitivo!  My lady love the SPA so I also take my extra time to join and was the best idea I had ! This is definitely the Best SPA We ever try in Italy , we had our personalize treatments ad at the end a fantastic relax overlooking the City of Milano .                                                                                                                                              The rooms are beautifully appointed, We stayed in an executive suite this time and was absolutely stunning sensation basically a luxury Armani Home.I always enjoyed the Armani and the good feeling is that I find this place even better than the previous unlike other places that tend to turn down certain standards , We have noticed that  Armani Milano does always better time to time , at least this is the felling that we noticed every time we come to Milan that  from a good stay now becomes a Great stay ! So thank you to everyone makes our stay memorable.BRAVO!Looking forward to go back soon this year as well. C.&Natalie"

349710495,February 2016,4.0,Fantastic rooms and spa.,This hotel decorated in mostly one taupe colour is perfectly located in the heart of Milan.  Rooms and bar area all the same colour and it seems that something is missing to make it not so dramatic.  The spa is very private and relaxing.   They need help getting better shampoo and conditioner in the rooms the quality is not up to their standards.   The concierge closes the main access to the hotel at midnight and you need to ring the bell for access this is not 5 stars ?!?!?!   To many good options in Milan.  What saves this is the fantastic attitude of all the employees.

348072471,January 2016,5.0,Superb,"What can i say about this hotel that has not been said before. First of all, location, probably best location in Milan, specially if you are there for a short period and the primary purpose of your visit is shopping. From the moment you enter the lobby, the smell of the perfume, just takes you away. the rooms were impeccable as always, the staff were fantastic. The Spa is amazing, it is actually one of my favorite things about this property, perfect for you to relax and wine down the long day. Also this hotel has probably the best room amenities of any hotel i have ever been to."
345379285,January 2016,5.0,"Superlative service, exquisite ultramodern elegance","The Milan Armani immerses its guests in sleek, clever Italian design.  The location is perfect for walking to La Scala, the Duomo, the shopping district, and several excellent museums.  The view of the Milan skyline from the upstairs reception desk (as well as the gym and the bar) is wonderful.  In light of the many comforts and amenities that the hotel offered, the price was very reasonable.  The best feature of our four-day stay was the consistently extraordinary service from the moment we were greeted by Francesco, one of the ""lifestyle managers,"" upon entering the hotel, until long after we left, when one of the managers called to make sure that we had picked up our tickets to Da Vinci's Last Supper that they'd arranged for us two weeks earlier.  We send our thanks to the entire staff, with special thanks to Francesco, Roberta, and Ricardo for their thoughtfulness."
345202463,February 2016,4.0,Very Armani great service,The staff here are very helpful and it makes difference to be greeted by friendly service. I loved the lounge at the Lobby level on the 7th floor it was just so relaxing and peaceful. I did find it slightly irritating to have to take 2 lifts to get into our room as you need to go to the lobby on the 7th floor then take another lift to your room. In our case on the 5th. The rooms are very typical of Armani style pared down neutral colours. I didn't like the panel division in our room which made the whole space appear and feel much smaller. Everything is high tech operated by sleek iPads which is fun but again annoying a receptive basis. I hated all the gadget switches as at night they had all the  marker light they not making the room absolutely dark which is what I like. I also did not like the all on one shower gel shampoo and lack of conditioner but loved their q tips and  mini bar . The one thing that frequently annoys me in great hotels is that no account is made of a place with mirror to sit to do make up and dry ones hair. Location is great
343720423,January 2016,5.0,Business Trip in Milan,"Armani Hotel Milano, has always been my preferred hotel of choice while visiting Milan, the location is excellent with alot of great shopping nearby, hotel rooms and facilities are great, armani restaurant and food quality is also well done."
343637591,January 2016,5.0,"Great standards, great location","A beautiful, high standard, posh hotel. Polite services, you can see that staff is making every effort. Great location. A bit lifeless, and doesn‚Äôt have the locals‚Äô buzz like Bulgari. One of only four options for the top notch international traveler in Milano: Four Seasons, Bulgari, Mandarin Oriental and of course Armani."

A Rua Montenapoleone, a Duomo e a Galeria Victorio Emanuelle s√£o bem pertos de l√°. H√° alguns restaurantes pr√≥ximos (Don Carlos, Paper Moon, Armani Caf√©). O lobby e o bar do hotel s√£o muito legais, bem modernos e descolados. O bar serve bons drinks e vinhos. Uma das atendentes do Concierge me pareceu muito arrogante, mas as demais foram prestativas. O quarto n√£o √© t√£o grande, mas √© satisfat√≥rio. Todo o controle de luzes, cortinas e temperaturas √© feito atrav√©s de iPad, o que pode dificultar a vida de quem n√£o √© adepto √† tecnologias, como os senhores mais velhos.

336941247,October 2015,5.0,Great experience in the middle of Milan,"It was a short 4 nights stay. We have a small suite with a window on the inside. The suite was in black style and every light and temperature is controlled via 2 ipads, one in the bed room and another one in the living room. Even the TV was connected.The reception is on the last floor next to the great bar and the breakfast room. Once you check in you go down to the rooms. It takes some time to get used to it.Most of the staff are non italians, Breakfast is very good with a view on Milano. The room is very comfortable, and most important very cozy. The hotel is very centrally located, 10 minutes walk from the large cathedral."
336779164,December 2015,3.0,Modern design but lack 5 star qualities,"The good: modern design, room was large and clean. They moved us to a different room when we had issues with the first one. The bad: we waited 45 minutes for our car after check out despite paying 65 Euros per night for the hotel garage: this was exemplary of how everything seems to happen in the hotel. The personnel are friendly but nobody seems to have a clue what they are supposed to be doing, the hotel management must be completely incompetent. The buffet breakfast is 3 star quality. The first room we were given was cold no matter how high we raised the thermostat, and very noisy due to the windows not being insulated. When we complained we were given a different room which was much better."
336340345,December 2015,5.0,overview of hotel,"the hotel was situated in an excellent spot very close walking distance to all the amazing shops.The hotel was clean and the food quality great, the spa is nice but not outstanding with very little relaxations seats in the main area."
334676461,August 2015,4.0,Too cool for school.,"A very contemporary modern building with minimalist overtones. Greeted by you g men in dark suits, to a separate lift to the reception area. Corridors are dark and seemless, door entrances are flush with the walls and in cared by a change in colour/ texture. Electronic card touched to a plate in the wall opens the door. The room IS wow. My expectation was met, although the overall feel was dark, but pools of light lit the room beautifully. Fantastic bedding , furniture and writing desk, but I felt slightly confined. The bathroom was a seamless marble terrazzo masterpiece, with huge glass doors to toilet and walk in shower. Armani toiletries provided, and of course bathrobes and slippers . the bath was a good size (I'm 6'2"") but I found myself in the shower more. The spa area was fantastic, a jacuzzi and modern beds to relax on . There was a restaurant but I didn't eat there. The hotel ,to me, lacked warmth, but was a very good experience. It was a well designed and superbly decorated hotel. And of course, an Armani shop underneath. If you like fashion, if you want to feel like a king/ queen , then you'll love it here. Like a living vogue magazine, Milan did not disappoint."
329052796,November 2015,5.0,It can always be better,"Good quality of stay, very well located, the bar staff were very nice. Rooms actually O thought they could be extremely unique design but it was another 4* hotel with the name armani, def. Recomend the property for any type of stay."

291174339,July 2015,5.0,The most stylish and luxurious hotel in Milan,Style and luxury started even before entering in the building. The stylish Armani feeling inside was unbelievable: luxurious italian marble everywhere and esquisite hospitality from the staff and private lifeatyle manager in elegant black suites.Incredible view of the Duomo Cathedral from the balcony of the room. Relaxing spa on the rooftopA must to try in Milan
290772653,July 2015,1.0,Poor service and no communication,My wife and 4 year old daughter had to wait 4 hours before they allowed her to check in. Early check in is not by accommodating us an hour prior to check in time. No assistance or willingness from employees or recommendations in trying to assist. Not even a simple welcome drink. I had to leave them in the lobby and rushed out for a meeting. After numerous calls I made to the hotel from my meeting room they finally assisted my family and gave them the room at 2 pm. This is disgusting that the employees don't care about the quality of the guest that reside at their hotel I would never reside here again.
289729361,June 2015,5.0,"location, location, location","The hotel is amazing, the rooms are lavish although a bit tight unless you have a suite, but the size of the bathroom more than makes up for it, with their luxurious amenities. I have to say this is the one of the main reasons I came back to this hotel.The smell of the body wash is superb, and in this crazy Italian heat will have you showering more than necessary just to enjoy it.But as you may have guessed it is the location that makes this hotel so perfect for almost anything you wish to do in Milan.Located next to the underground on Via Manzoni, directly across the road from Via Monte Napoleone (a shoppers paradise), 5 mins walk to the Teatro Della Scala, and 10 mins walk to the Duomo and the Galleria, what more could you ask for close enough to all the attractions but far enough away for you to feel like a local as you wonder back to the hotel through the surrounding streets."
260727230,August 2014,3.0,5 Sterne?,"Wir waren letzen August f√ºr eine Nacht im Armani Hotel. Ich kenne das Hotel von Dubai und war dort sehr begeistert. Leider war das in Mailand gar nicht der Fall.F√ºr das Einchecken sind wir √ºber 30 Min. angestanden bis uns dann jemand unser Zimmer gezeigt hat. Das Zimmer war eigentlich sehr sch√∂n, nur leider nach so kurzer Zeit schon sehr abgewohnt.Das Fr√ºhst√ºck anderntags war wirklich eine Zumutung:wir haben gute 20 Min. auf den Kaffee/Tee gewartet und geschlagene 30 Min. auf 2 weiche Eier. Das Buffet war leer gefuttert von Arabern, die Crew war nicht gross bem√ºht, dieses wieder aufzuf√ºllen, und zwar so, wie es sich f√ºr ein 5 Sterne Hotel geh√∂ren w√ºrde.Wir werden das n√§chste Mal wieder in ein super Hotel Hotel ganz in der N√§he gehen, wo man neben sehr freundlichem Personal schon von einem wunderbaren Duft in der Lobby empfangen wird."

243281932,December 2014,5.0,Superb,"My daughter and I stayed 2 nights in this fabulous hotel. i was very impressed on arrival, at the attentiveness of the doormen. Our luggage was attended to expediently and up we went to the first floor for check in. The staff were delightful. So professional, polite and helpful.When we entered our rooms, I was gobsmacked. The decor was luxurious and very serene. The bed was so comfortable. The bathroom facilities, once again, luxurious. A full size bath, separate shower and separate toilet and bidet. The Snow White towels were soft and fluffy and plenty of them.There is a coffee machine with a good range of coffee pods. But I was disappointed there was no milk. I am sure a call to room service would have provided this. Also, as I am a tea drinker, some teabags would be a good idea as the coffee machine does provide hot water.The breakfast menu is quite extensive, but I thought it was a bit expensive.Once again, the staff were very attentive, and professional in the breakfast dining room.Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we didn't get the chance to try their other dining options,maybe because we were too busy shopping.The hotel is situated in a fantastic area. Close to quality shops and not far from the magnificentMilan Cathedral.After we checked out, we had time to spare, so we relaxed by the indoor pool.I could not speak more highly of this fabulous hotel. I hope management appreciate their staff, they are their greatest asset. Nothing is too much trouble and they made my stay even more memorable."

234375593,July 2014,3.0,It's a cold cold heart,"We stayed in the suite with my husband and 7 year old daughter for 2 nights. If we had to stay in Milan more we would have moved out. It's elegant, it's stylish, it's all about design. If you feel yourself an accessory this is your place. But if you want to feel yourself a human being don't you even think about this place. The lifts, the corridors, the bedroom it's all about being style in grey. We all felt very uncomfortable. Also we got the feeling this hotel is not really kids friendly. It's not bad, but this is a fact that the hotel could have mentioned at least on their internet site. I am not complaining, just sharing the feeling we got from the place. It's not for family. Could be good for business. P.s. The spa was very good."

200130987,April 2014,3.0,"Armani does fashion, but shouldn't do hotels","Recently stayed here for a number of days for business. After a long flight and late arrival, this hotel became quite obvious that they really only prefer the celebrity type. The welcome from staff was quite cold and walking into the building it seems like a big old public hospital, very clinical. Armani is famous for their fashion- clean, simple well cut fashion. They have tried the same technique with their hotel but it lacks sadly, they have gone so far overboard with a minimalist approach that it becomes fussy.Trying to find the fan/air conditioning button was a nightmare - hint it is on the wall behind the bedside lamp. Look out for it. For women if you want to apply makeup, forget about it. The lighting is so bad in the bathroom and the bedroom that it is a hopeless cause. This frustrated me immensely, getting into work only to then be able to see how badly the makeup had been applied due to poor lighting.The hotel is in a fabulous location for shopping, the bed is amazingly comfortable, but assigning a lifestyle coach to each room is ridiculous. Although maybe they could have assisted with turning the tv on, post 3 days I still couldn't work this out. Apparently hitting 'on' on the remote and selecting a channel is to simple.Room menu should be more traditional as well and have more pasta dishes, you are in Italy after all.The room is lovely, just too over complicated and poor lighting."

You feel like a classic hollywood celebrity.2. Large beautiful bathroom, very well designed, down to the lighting.3. Just opposite shopping district4. Large bedroom, high quality bedsheets, pillows, bedspreads5. Snacks & drinks refillable 6. Located beside subway7. Breakfast is very lux and posh. You feel like you need to dress a tuxedo to eat. 8. The chocolates are delectable.Cons:1. Sometimes you get a feeling like the staff is looking at how you dress and judging you. (Or maybe its just me... but they do dress very nicely.)2. Service is a little cold at times. Can be warmer. 3. Quite expensive."
188195681,December 2013,5.0,You must visit!  -- even for a cocktail,"We had an early appointment to go see the Last Supper.  On the way to the church, we noticed the Armani Hotel, and decided to return for breakfast.  OMG, this was so worth it.  We took the elevator to the 7th floor which had a beautiful view over the rooftops of Milan.  It was enchanting. We were the first people in the restaurant and the staff was incredible.  My husband had an omelet, and I had steamed vegetables.  We did not get the buffet, as it was very expensive and we did not want to eat that much.  We sat and drank coffee and just enjoyed the view.  The hotel is beautifully decorated and worth seeing.After leaving the hotel, we found a gorgeous rococo church directly across the street.  The hotel is in the middle of the ""Golden Triangle"" so it was easy to leave there and visit all the high end shops."
184950810,November 2013,2.0,Poor service as well Management,"My Expectation were very high, but unfortunately the hotel service as well as the food & beverage quality (the worst margarita I ever hat in my life) did not met my expectations at all! Also my jacket which I got back from the laundry was damaged due to wrong handling by the laundry team! It seems that the management is saving on wrong areas which is a pity, because the hotel it self is beautiful and located next to the dome.......The restaurant manager (during breakfast) was more than service& quality driven, but he had to cover the service breakdowns by theservice employees!Over all, not satisfying. Next time I probably stay with the other fashion brand who runs also Hotels....."

146995738,December 2012,5.0,Back to the future,"This hotel made me feel as if I was transported to somewhere in the future as the designs of the hotel are very stylistic and elegant. This is my first stay in an Armani Hotel as I did not get a chance to stay in the one in Dubai as it was not open yet when I was there. I was contemplating staying in the Park Hyatt in Milan again but I thought why not stay in another location which was right at the heart of the shopping street this time. I tried the spa which was very nice. Massage was good. I spent part of my afternoon here after shopping as it had started to snow and I did not feel like walking in the street. The spa was a good escape. Although the lobby is located at the seventh floor, the lift came very promptly when I arrived at the hotel downstairs and immediately whisked me upstairs to the seventh floor. My room was on the 4th floor so it meant I had to take a lift down to the 4th floor from the lobby which was located on the 7th floor. And if I wanted to go back downstairs it meant I had to change lifts twice which was still ok as the lifts were very fast. Overall I liked staying at this hotel and it was a different kind of experience and a good one. Everything inside the hotel room was branded with Armani including the coffee and the mineral water. You could see that a lot of small touches were added."

A total of four nights in two different rooms, one a suite, the luxury and service is ultra-first-class, amenities endless.  The lighting, decor and mood is sublime.

Special note goes to Aaron, General Manager;  Natasha, Lifestyle Manager; Massimilliano, Restaurant Captain; Antonio, Server;  Fabiano, Bellman/Greeter.....I could go on and on."
144060521,October 2012,4.0,"Stylish, seductive beauty but with some teething problems","Stayed a couple of nights here, nicely upgraded to a premier room. As expected, Armani's interior decor does not disappoint - the furnishings are stunning - the rooms are individual and stylish - although lacking in light. Roberto Cavalli likened the Armani hotel to a ""psychiatric hospital"" and it certainly does have this aspect to it too.Service is slightly uneven - there are some exceptional staff but then some who let the side down. The problems are worsened by layout. You have to take a lift to the main lobby on the 7th floor which does not lead immediately to the reception area. When you first arrive you face a desk which is not a reception desk - what is it? who knows?The lady who eventually greeted us was obviously quite stressed out. Can I help you please? she asked. In a top class hotel, she would have greeted me by name knowing that I was here to check in. Mr Armani certainly needs to recruit much more staff to improve service. She seemed unable to cope with so many customers arriving at the same time. Rooms were not ready and they had not anticipated how to deal with early check in. Yes, it is a popular hotel but the staff need to be trained properly so they are a) positive at all times b) smiling even under difficult conditions c) always seeking to please the customer. I detected a slight resistance in some staff to fulfil these basic customer service demands. Others did not appear to have a basic grasp of English - a weakness in an international hotel servicing customers from across the globe. Responsiveness to pre-reservation emails was extremely poor - always a sign of shoddy customer service.My doubts were compounded when we arrived for 'appertivo' at the Armani bar. The furnishings and location are stunning but we felt that something was missing. What was it? Perhaps atmosphere was lacking - things seemed a bit sterile. Service at the bar was extremely slow - we received a menu after about 15 minutes. By contrast, when I visited Bulgari hotel, I just sat down in the lobby and someone immediately came up to me with a menu - very impressive. If the Armani hotel wishes to truly complete with Bulgari hotel, it needs to instil much more discipline and professionalism in staff members. They need to be more efficient and respond to customers immediately. There are too many people walking around looking important and doing nothing to add value to the business. These people should frankly help the other staff or find another job. Having said this, there are some staff who are professional - the door staff, for instance, were faultless and one lady at reception was superb. It is the interaction between reception and the bar area which needs to be improved.The spa on the top floor is the piece de resistance of this Armani hotel. The facilities are extremely good - an impressive steam room, the loungers and the jacuzzi offer a spectacular location - although this becomes less spa-like during busy times. You have to be aware though that there are very few female therapists here which is unusual and can be off-putting. There is also a general lack of communication and instruction. The operation needs to be much more professional - it is too laid back and chaotic - as are other parts of the hotel.This returns to Roberto Cavalli's ""psychiatric hospital"" taunt. There is some truth here. This is a young hotel and there are some mix-ups which really shouldn't happen at a deluxe five star hotel. I would say the facilities are five star plus but the service is three star. Mr Armani must either change some of the staff or re-train them to deliver the perfection that his customers deserve. The idea of the lifestyle manager is laudable, but I didn't even get to meet mine! Rather than have this, why not just stick to the tried and tested 'concierge' - it works in other hotels, why not Armani?The corridors are dark and the rooms do sometimes resemble padded cells - to get anything to work you must master a clunky remote control. This is another area of improvement. If you wish to blend technological sophistication with cool interior decor, you need to get it right. The remote control is ugly and the television set-up is strangely one-dimensional - not many good quality graphics and all monochrome. It simply does not work well.So, to sum up, what needs to improve is the staff's professionalism and the technology better matching the beauty of the luxurious interior. The principles are all right in Armani's philosophy, now he needs to really execute them to create the perfect hotel in Milan.For background, I have stayed at Mandarin Oriental New York, KL, The James, New York, Madinat Jumeirah, Dubai, Ritz Carlton, Hong Kong, Four Seasons, Bora Bora, Villa D'este, Cernobbio, Shangri-La Paris, Four Seasons, Seychelles, St Pancras Renaissance, London."

Initially I was afraid that I would be constantly offered to go to an Armani Shop - but not the case, the staff was very correct and didn't give any preferences to a brand. Loved Milan and the hotel, if I ever return (and I plan to do it;))) will stay in this hotel, highly recommended, probably one of the best we stayed so far."

An espresso machine that works was nice, thank you.Cons1. The place really lacks character.  Minimlistic, in an ugly fashion.  I felt trapped in a mental    asylum, a very trendy mental asylum.2. The everything-all-purpose remote control does not work.  Not practical.  I'm very impatient   and found the lighting functions and remote to be very frustrating.  3. For a new 700 Euro a night hotel I expected my toilet to not stink!  There was clearly mold growing in the enclosed shower.  This should not be acceptable.  Smell was overwhelming.4. AC would not work!  Then again it seems all ACs in Italian hotel don't work.Overall it was a nice hotel, more like a novelty item.  I will not be staying there again as it really felt depressing.  I will also not be recommending it.  For 700 Euro a night there are much better alternatives nearby."

While no noise can be heard in the rooms, the lobby bar and front entrance may get loud and crowded during the night - which is not really a 5 star hotel feeling...."

702775313,August 2019,4.0,Good experience - a few missing points,"This place oozes with design, as you would expect with the brand.  We were given a complementary upgrade to a larger room which was very appreciated.  The room had a round foyer, which was unique and made you feel you were coming 'home'.  The concierge team is hard working and aims to please which is appreciated especially in months like August when much of the town is shut down.  A few points to improve:we only realised after making purchases in the Armani shop downstairs that guests were entitled to a discount.  I found this at random on the iPad in the room.  why was this not made a special feature?  we asked for a harder pillow - it took several requests to get one.Parking is extraordinarily high - we were charged 65Euro / night.  I understand this is Milan, but keep in mind this is the first thing your guests learn when they arrive, which is a negative!  Include it in the price or offer it up front more clearly."
700300179,August 2019,3.0,"We loved the place, but this time we were disappointed.","We are frequent visitors of this hotel, which was our favorite place in Milano. But this time service was way below average, repetitively over a few days, and the staff seemed fairly superficial in their attempt to remedy our experience. No real attempt to make an unhappy client into a happy one.Before, the super-service felt genuine, this time it felt as if the staff members were 'forced' to put up a show of a good service, but service was not as good as before. Some front desk staff members were indifferent and some of the staff members at the entrance were really rude. Maintenance and housekeeping staff (and we needed those more than one would expect) could not speak English or communicate with us.Next time Four Seasons."

685016949,June 2019,5.0,Beautiful hotel - miss pay TV,"Beautiful hotel right in the middle of Milan's fashion district. Minimalistic, but soothing and large enough rooms in pure Armani style. You will probably feel the need to replenish your wardrobe in the nearby boutiques, so the space is appreciated. The only complain is the absurdly missing pay TV, who broadcasts all sports in Italy. Staff was kind and prepared. Special mention to room service David, who served us perfectly for a week and was so kind to lend us his online account so that we could see Raptors final game. Very nice Spa."

The service is slick with style. The position was very convenient and a 5 min walk to the Duomo. To our surprise , we discovered that our neighbor in the room next door was none other than Rihanna. So many security personnel in the corridors. Was fun ."

655455196,February 2019,2.0,Designer Imposter Perfume,"I am extremely disappointed in our stay and at the level of service. This was our first (and last) time staying at Armani. We usually stay at Bulgari or Park Hyatt Milano, but both were completely booked for fashion week, even though I did book almost a year in advance, nevertheless, as an American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts property, we booked a Premier King at Armani. You should not equate technology with luxury!  When we first arrived at the hotel, we walked in and no one was at the desk at street level, a man did appear and said we needed to go up to the lobby to check in (FYI, the Lobby is on the 7th floor, you take one elevator from street level to lobby, and a different set of elevators for rooms).  Our room was beautiful, though note there are no doorknobs to access your room and the rooms are controlled entirely by iPad (the lights, the drapes, the temperature, the TV...everything).  After getting settled, we went out and when we came back, we could not get the door to our room opened.  We swiped, it turned green, we were pushing, and nothing.  Finally, we went to the front desk, where Roberta was amazing.  She came to our room and threw her entire body weight at our door to get it to open.  This level of push was surprising and should not be necessary, so Roberta contacted someone to fix it and we did not have the problem again.  She is the hotel's best asset!The Bathroom: The bathroom has a welcoming tub, but there were no bath products or amenities, which was shocking, there is even a nook for them at the front of the tub, but there was no soap, no bubble bath, no salts, no shampoo, no loofah, nothing.  There was 1 bottle of shampoo/body wash in the shower, that we had to bring to the tub and then back to the shower area.The Noise:  There was significant booming noises coming from above sporadically, though often, through the night and during the day.  When we discussed it with the front desk they suggested it was The Club, but it was not the Club, we did not hear music, but rather the sound of furniture being moved and dropped, and it continued throughout our stay with no explanation (and also no sleep).The Glow:  I appreciate the technology incorporated throughout the room and that it is all controlled by iPad, but all of the tech and sensors incorporated into the walls to accommodate causes the room to glow blue light and I had to tape postcards and maps over everything to make it dark enough to fall asleep (even though the noise referenced above precluded sleep altogether).  The Complimentary Mini-Bar:  This is a great touch, we used it, we appreciated it, it is a very nice perk, but can't help thinking it is there because the level of service is so poor that this is a cheap fix to make people happy.As I expressed all of these concerns to the front desk throughout our stay, and to the Lifestyle Manager on our day of departure, I was hopeful that a discount or refund of some portion of our stay would be applied, after all the room rate was 850 Euro/night plus tax and we were unable to sleep or even take a relaxing bath at this ""luxury"" hotel.  The hotel is beautiful, and it is filled with beautiful people (especially during Fashion Week), but it was not luxury accommodation or service, it was not even comfortable accommodation, it is more like designer imposter perfume.  We received a lovely parting gift in hopes of us giving Armani another chance when we next return  to Milan, but I think it says a lot about the complete lack of understanding of guests' needs that the parting gift was a room diffuser, which is 8 fluid ounces, flammable, and cannot be brought on an airplane... I would have preferred a a partial refund."
648489875,April 2018,5.0,Absolutely amazing hotel :),Stayed in the Armani hotel in April last year and had to do this review as I literally fell in love with this place. My partner and I stayed for 4 nights and we had a lovely stay in Milan which was our first time I Italy too. We had a suite and it was absolutely beautiful inside really big and spacious with own balcony. I loved it it felt like an apartment - the rooms have this chic cool vibe but not super modern so still traditional! The bed was ultra comfy and I like the room as we had electric blinds and it got totally dark.The bathroom has shower and bath and both bedroom and bathroom were spotless. The hotel has a special smell which they must put into the heating cooling system and it just smells lovely all the time in rooms and reception etc. The spa was on a higher level and consists of a jacuzzi pool sauna and steam - you can have your own steam or sauna rooms they had multiple small ones to use and can go in pairs. Slippers robe water and fruit provided and the view from the pool is amazing! We liked how quiet it was and relaxing. The staff are really helpful and polite - the reception staff got us taxis and offered us a map of the city where they wrote down some main attractions places to eat etc I cannot fault this hotel it is in perfect location close to the cathedral and many shops boutiques and restaurants. We walked most days into town and only got cabs home from dinners at night. This hotel is definitely worth a trip and worth every penny - truly beautiful!!
648455588,December 2018,3.0,Recensione solo della Armani Spa,"Come da titolo, non abbiamo soggiornato presso l‚Äôhotel ma abbiamo usufruito della Spa con un trattamento.Accoglienza in reception Spa ottima, ci √® stato chiesto se avevamo preferenze sul massaggio, zone di fastidio o di preferenze, l‚Äôintensit√† e se preferivamo olio o crema. Gradevole e Attento, ci siamo sentiti subito come coccolati.Spogliatoi , molto ben curati, ma limitato lo spazio per il cambio a due sole sedute; mentre sia le doccie, che la zona trucco/specchio/lavandino, molto ampia.Al mio ingresso era tutto in ordine, quando invece ho dovuto usufruire io di asciugamani per la doccia e il cambio ho trovato molto disordine, consiglierei un passaggio in piu per il riassettamento degli ambienti.Sono presenti asciugacapelli, set da doccia , accappatoio e sacchettini per il costume bagnato.All‚Äôinterno della piccola spa, la vasca con vista sulla citt√† √® l‚Äôattrazione principale.Un vero peccato, e per questo non ho dato il massimo dei voti, la presenza di solo 6 sedute sdraio in tutta la spa,con un numero maggiore di ospiti presenti.cosi come la maleducazione di chi lasciava gli asciugamani per occupare la sdraio mentre effettuava il trattamento dei massaggi.Servizio da migliorare.Saune e bagno turco,intime, ma ottime,servizio di tisane e beveraggio discreto, assente, il cibo, se non una selezione di arance.Su richiesta di qualcosa di dolce, anche solo 2 biscotti per√≥ siamo stati accontentati .Massaggio sublime in un ambiente raffinato.La ragazza che ha eseguito il massaggio √® stata bravissima e molto professionale,cercando di coniugare un massaggio drenante con uno relax per la schiena.Ho potuto anche scegliere l‚Äôaroma dell‚Äôolio per il massaggio, la musica nella stanza e la quantit√† di luce.Il massaggio vale tutto.L‚Äôesperienza quindi la consiglierei , ma dando piu spazio al massaggio e poco alla permanenza nella spa."

The team all over very friendly, helpfull and professional, they made the hotel a great experience.Rooms win a lot when you spend a time - everything work so well, and all designed for the guests individual need in mind.Public spaces feels a bit empty and cold - its not a really happening hotel."

Il posto √® meraviglioso, ben tenuto, pulito, moderno, il classico posto che non vorresti lasciare pi√π.Il personale √® stato gentile e disponibile, ho usufruito dei servizi Spa e di un massaggio corpo da 50 minuti, la mia terapeuta √© stata molto professionale ed √® subito riuscita a mettermi a mio agio.Ho adorato anche poter passare del tempo tutto per me nell'area relax, un posto di pace che con le sue luci soffuse ti permette di perderti nei tuoi pensieri nella grande vasca idromassaggio, ti permette di scaldarti nelle saune e anche di bere tisane calde o fredde. Curato tutto nei minimi dettagli, un'esperienza che vale la pena provare!"

632359837,November 2018,5.0,Modern Excellence,"Some serious thought went into planning this hotel, which has wonderfully thought out rooms. I initially was a bit worried (on a busy road) and initially appeared a bit cold, but the rooms are a tour de force of how to build a hotel room. High tech but easy to operate room controls.  Excellent sound proofing from both exterior and internal noise and plenty of space. Really well done. Odd that they have shampoo and bath gel as a two in one and also odd that the conditioner comes in a packet (like the free samples you get sometimes). Odd slip in quality in an otherwise excellent room. Service was excellent from front desk, porters (very quick) and concierge. Ate at Bamboo Bar which was very good. Breakfast was solid, although I thought Four Seasons was a bit better. Probably just being picky. If you want a modern hotel in Milan you have two choices - this and the Park Hyatt. This is the better choice."

618533512,September 2018,5.0,Beyond expectations,"I guess you get what you pay for but in this instance you get more. The staff are amazing. They welcome you each time you walk by lobby. The staff at the bar are the same, always welcoming. Even door staff downstairs are amazingly friendly. Additionally the staff were great in arranging skip the line tours and arranging a trip outside of Milano for the day. The staff arranged the day tour the night before which was a big ask during fashion week. The room was a great size and housekeeping were also fabulous Cocktails and food at bamboo bar was excellent. So impressed we will be back and we can‚Äôt wait to see all the staff again"

571658954,April 2018,5.0,"Pricey, but you get what you pay for!","My fianc√© and I wanted I take a short babymoon so decided to treat ourselves and stay at the Armani Hotel for 4 nights. Upon arrival (and assuming due to availability), we were permitted to check in 3 hours early and were upgraded to a nicer room. The room had 2 large TVs in it; one in the bedroom and one in the sitting room area. Everything is controlled using a user-friendly iPad (we had 2 in our room for ease of access), including the blinds, the lighting and the entertainment system. There are lots of movies available free-of-charge on the TVs. You can even order extra pillows, food and pretty much anything else on the iPads. We did make the most of the pillow menu as we found the pillows and bed to be a little hard for our liking, but the option is there for you if you need it. We ordered food, evening drinks, wine and breakfast using the in-room dining service, and although extremely expensive, everything came very quickly (within 10-20 minutes) and was delicious. I would recommend the hot-chocolate to those looking for a non-alcoholic evening option! We made the most of the complimentary soft-drinks in the minibar too, which was a bonus as most hotels charge a lot for this service.We had the half-day spa experience which was fantastic; the spa is small, but felt exclusive as there were not many people around. The therapists were friendly and professional, and did well to adapt my treatment so that it was pregnancy friendly.The hotel is in a great location and we found ourselves wandering down various avenues, enjoying the luxuries that Milan has to offer. Duomo is only a 10 minute walk and the shopping area offers a variety of luxury and high-street shops and restaurants. We also took the opportunity to jump in an hour-long taxi to Lake Como for an afternoon. I was a little worried that we would find ourselves short of things to do in Milan, but there are many trips and activities to keep you occupied and we were not bored at all. Overall, a wonderful, relaxing stay at the Armani Hotel. It is costly, but in this case, you definitely get what you pay for."

567179286,June 2017,5.0,Flawless! An exceptional hotel in a fab location...,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic location and amazing service!!!Check in was straightforward with no issues. The staff overall were exceptionally attentive and accommodating.We stayed in the deluxe double which is their basic room but was far from basic, very spacious and both the room and bathroom had great views. The bed was very comfortable and room exceptionally clean. There is a 'walk in' wardrobe between the bathroom and bedroom. The design of the room was impeccable. It had everything you need including a Nespresso coffee machine.This is a tech savvy hotel which is explained thoroughly when you are taken to your room. The Wi fi was very good and there were no issues with this or the speed or anything in the room - everything ran smoothly and did what it was supposed to do.The indoor pool was great and has views outside of the hotel, the spa was lovely and the gym was well equipped and provided towels and bottled water.The lounge again was exceptional (it has a ventilated indoor smokers area next to it). There was a singer in one night who sang old school rnb, neo soul and general classics with a pianist - it was absolutely amazing.The food was slightly pricey but great! With saying this, it is Michelin star!The hotel is right next to Novikov and a few minutes walk from shopping galore and has the metro (Montenapoleone) in its immediate vicinity.I will definitely be returning on my next trip!"

547669590,May 2017,4.0,Armani style but..,"The hotel is well designed.. As its name is Armani fitting with all your expectations.Rooms are nice, service and staff are nice as well.. The only weird thing, they ask 400‚Ç¨ preauthorization from your card for your possible incidental charges ! Which is really insane. If you using an international credit card this refund can take weeks to be back and when this happens their apology ""mr we already send it back, its depends on your bank"". I traveled a lot but i never saw that they ask almost same as accommodation cost per night as block in your card.Once, they also couldn't close this pre-authorization.. They charged my extras as seperate charge and cancelled this pre-auth. At the end, i paid few hundreds and wait for release of another thousand a week. All other 5 star hotels took the credit card details or take like 50-100‚Ç¨ max per night if its hotel policy as guarantee of incidentals."
547259612,December 2017,4.0,Beige!,"Location is superb because it is just off the hardcore shopping district, the Quadrilatero della Moda, and also walking distance to all my business appointments. But being right on Via Manzoni can be noisy. I was awakened by the rumble of the trams. Personally I find the Armani Casa style rather dated. The endless beige on beige on beige doesn't feel terribly now but it can be soothing after an intense day of retail. And even if the style is not 2017, the tech is. Everything controlled by iPad including a wide range of music and videos. Super fun to stay in bed on a rainy day. Note that the minibar does not contain any alcohol, so for your nightcap you must go up to the bar or order room service. The soft drinks, however, are plentiful and gratis, which is great. Espresso machine in room is a clutch feature that I wish all hotels had. I agree that having to take two elevators to leave (one to the top, transfer and then one back down to the ground floor) is a design flaw. It adds 5 minutes to your exit."

544172782,November 2017,3.0,Not as amaying as expected...,"What can I say? One might think this is an amazing, gorgeous, stylish hotel from the King of Milan (as Armani is known by the locals), but alas, we were a little bit (or maybe a lot) disappointed with the establishment.1.       Location ‚Äì great. But I can imagine some people complaining (and indeed they are) that it is a bit far from the city centre ‚Äì you have to take a taxi or underground (which we did).2.       Building ‚Äì very modern. But a bit strange to have reception on one of the top floors, and then your guests have to take two different elevators from reception to the room and then outside.3.       The rooms itself ‚Äì super tech, space quality, controlled by an iPad. TV magically disappears away when you turn it off. I could imagine some people would find it amusing. We were happy with one button which would turn every light off. Otherwise ‚Äì great, but moving on‚Ä¶4.       The bathroom ‚Äì great heated floors, alas, the water was not so heated, and then it suddenly was scalding hot, and then it was lukewarm again. You get the drift. I noticed a number of people are complaining about this. So beware! You will get two bottles of shower gel/shampoo (yes, all in one, this kind of stuff) and 1 sachet (I kid you not!) of hair conditioner. One sachet yeah, so good luck trying to rip it open when you are showering (wet hands, scalding water etc.).5.       The SPA ‚Äì tiny! Saunas are ‚Äúprivate‚Äù and can only accommodate 2 people at a time ‚Äì if I am not mistaken there are 3 of them. Swimming pool ‚Äì it is actually a Jacuzzi. You cannot swim there. About 10-12 spaces to lay dawn. NOT ENOUGH!6.       The breakfast ‚Äì for 50 Euro a head ‚Äì wow‚Ä¶ I had better breakfasts in 4 star hotels. Omelette was lovely though.7.       Personnel ‚Äì fantastic! All friendly and eager to help, except fro one grumpy lady at the breakfast restaurant who saw us trying to get her attention and just moved on, saying somebody would come to get our coffees order (with an attitude like it was below her!). BUT OTHERWISE I PRAISE THE PERSONNEL ‚Äì NICE, HELPFUL, FRIENDLY. A real asset of the hotel!Curious observation: there is a list in the room with prices from glasses to towels should you wish to take one or two home as a souvenir. The prices start at Euro 60. For a simple glass glass! I wonder how much money they make from this line of business.Will we recommend this hotel ‚Äì most probably not."

However, with regard to the things that really matter, the room was clean, very cool, good air conditioning, good wifi internet, great bathroom and very quiet. No street noise or hallway noise.

Service is focused on personalised touch - from the check in to check out - personal would know your name (to my biggest surprise, how do they do it!), they literally take care of the smallest request you ask for. Rooms are totally digitalised and have best amenities and features! Restaurants are so posh and stylish you just feel like real diva there! SPA is on the top floor - oh you just have to see it! The location is at the epicentre of Milan - literally! In the same building you have Armani Hashi (Japanese restaurant) and Armani Prive (nightclub) both places are main happening in the city!

Breakfast is not included and the prices for it are a bit high around 40 euros, but there is a variety of foods on the buffet to choose from and cooked dishes are done just the way they should be. The Bamboo bar located in the hotel is very busy since it is quite popular with non-hotel guests. We will definitely be back to stay when we come back to Milan again.Stayed January 2017, traveled as a couple"

The staff was the nicest and of course the location is perfect. And the best part: The rooms !!!! I've never been in such an amazing, luxurious and spacious Room. It has a small hall that can be closed, a beautiful coffee station and the most amazing and huge bathroom. Everything is controlled with an iPad, but is very easy (I'm not technological at all). That Bamboo Bar is stunning, as everything else in the hotel. The only thing as a negative I have to mention, but that didn't really bothered me at all, is that the carpet in the room looks a little bit used. It was perfectly cleaned, don't get me wrong, but you can see the five years that it has been there. If you have the opportunity to stay here, DO IT ! You won't regret it. It's expensive, yes, but the experience is completely worth it."

442210274,November 2016,5.0,UN ANGOLO DI PARADISO IN CENTRO CITTA'!,"Da subito l' Armani Hotel t' incanta con la cortesia all'arrivo, la professionalit√† di tutto il personale, la cordialit√†, i profumi e l' eleganza dello stile Armani.Ho soggiornato qualche settimana fa in questo meraviglioso hotel: la stanza era pulitissima, funzionale e confortevole. Al ristorante, una cena da leccarsi i baffi, (consiglio l' assaggio dell' UOVO 65¬∞ con quinoa, cavolfiore, miso, acciughe e crumble) un' esplosione di sapori !!! Al mattino una colazione super abbondante, ricca di tante prelibatezze. Non posso non citare la SPA, ubicata all' ultimo piano dell' hotel con vista mozzafiato sulla citt√†. Al suo interno una zona relax, piscina jacuzzi, sauna e bagno turco. Ho avuto, inoltre, la fortuna di fare un massaggio con il bravo e professionale Mohamed che mi ha rigenerata.Nulla √® lasciato al caso, tutto √® perfetto con servizi eccellenti. Una nota di merito va a tutto lo staff, dal ricevimento al ristorante, tutti cordiali, disponibili e preparati.Spero di tornare al pi√π presto in questo hotel, dove la sobriet√† del lusso, la cura del dettaglio e l'attenzione al cliente sono le caratteristiche dominanti."

439552708,November 2016,5.0,Beat expectations!,"If you want something different in terms of interior design and uniqueness, away from traditional hotels where hospitality is still of high standards then the Armani hotel is the best option in Milan. Service is at its best with all the staff very polite and helpful. Rooms are of good size, very clean and all refreshments and small nibbles and chocolates complimentary. There is also a Nespresso machine. (small things but make a difference). Everything in the room is controlled from an iPad which adds to the sleek nature of the hotel. Bathroom is big offering a shower and bath tub.The lounge bar is modern, with good selection of drinks and food and nice music. We ate at the lounge and the restaurant and would definitely recommend the restaurant in terms of value and quality. We had an amazing 3 course lunch at the restaurant overlooking the Duomo and clearly the food and the service meet the standards of a Michelin restaurant. Would definitely recommend if you visit the hotel to have a lunch or dinner there.There is also a spa and gym with a view of Milan from the top which is amazing.Would definitely go back and recommend for a stay."
439180849,November 2016,5.0,"Excellent hotel, Fantastic experience.","Everything about the hotel is simply outstanding. The quality of service, the friendly multilingual staff, the interior and exterior of the hotel, the quality of the room. The bathroom is gorgeous, the walking closet is fantastic. The bed is so comfortable, and the most interesting thing about the room is that you can control everything through the rooms ipad. Everything meaning, the lights/curtains/tv/DND wake up calls/ laundry... Unfortunately I didn't get the chance to spend time in the lounge but it looked great. The location of the hotel is excellent since its the middle of the city center and close to all the luxury shops/restaurants. The welcoming staff are very friendly, well versed, and presentable. my flight arrived 8 am and my check in was not until 3 pm, but the staff provided my room in 10 mins, which was a wonderful gesture and great service from them. Armani hotel Milan is definitely a 10+ and you feel at home and welcomed by everyone, the price is a bit high but to a certain extent the experience is worth it."
438022523,November 2016,4.0,Lo stile inconfondivile di Re Giorgio in un hotel di lusso,"Armani hotel rispecchia a pieno lo stile di Giorgio Armani: eleganza, sobriet√†, linee pulite e solide. Austerit√†, un hotel contemporaneo con materiali pregiati (marmo e onice ovunque), il massimo della domotica e della privacy. Tutto brandizzato by Giorgio Armani: dai fiori agli arredi, dai cioccolatini ai tessili. La palette colori va dal nero al greige alle sfumature di grigio, con tocchi di verdone e beige. Una meravigliosa spa con vista su Milano, un bar ristorante con vista a 270 gradi oltre ad una palestra (anch'essa con vista sulla citt√†) e il negozio Armani al piano terra. Sofisticato e unico nel suo genere!"
437081122,November 2016,5.0,Eine Oase mitten in der Stadt!,"Es f√§llt mir nicht leicht Worte f√ºr dieses, in allen Bereichen hervorragende Hotel, zu finden.Ich war schon an vielen guten Adressen, aber das Armani Hotel toppt sie alle! Kulinarisch gesehen h√§tte ich jeden Tag in diesem Hotel essen sollen, denn so manch top Lokal kommt nicht an den Koch mit 1 Michelin-Stern ran. Das durchaus junge Team war extrem zuvorkommend und freundlich. Ob der Wellnessbereich mit Blick auf den Dom, das Fitnesscenter oder der sich im Haus befindende Club Prive, man hat in diesem Hotel wirklich Alles vereint! Ich bin von dem Innendesign & den Farben die Giorgio Armani hier verwendet hat absolut hin und weg. Man sieht dass sehr viel Liebe zum Detail und absolute Perfektion hinter wirklich Allem steckt. Das gesamte Zimmer (Licht, W√§rme, Roomservice etc. l√§sst sich extrem simpel mit dem Ipad steuern, sodass man eigentlich nie den Roomservice bzw. die Rezeption anrufen muss) Am meisten bin ich jedoch von dem unvergleichlichen Duft der sich wie ein roter Faden unaufdringlich durch das ganze Hotel zieht begeistert. Ich hoffe sehr bald wieder in diesem magischen Hotel urlauben und relaxen zu k√∂nnen."

416970846,August 2016,5.0,Wonderful Experience! What could be better than Armani?,"I surprised my 18 year old Daughter with a stay at the beautiful Armani Hotel Milano in August. A wish she has had for five years and thought might not ever come true. We travelled 18 hours from Philadelphia to Milan, arriving tired and cranky and stepped out of the taxi into an 'oasis'. From the moment you pass by the Armani Hotel Mercedes transport at the front door and the three handsome Italian men complete in their ""Armani"" couture, you KNOW you have stepped in to pure Milano. Even the smell past the front doors was charismatic. Was that really Rosmarino?? The elegant elevator lifts you up to a place even more beautiful than that last introduction. Step left and you are greeted by the most helpful and welcoming reception crew- promising to make every request their most important task for the day. I wish I could remember the names of the two lovely women who helped us daily with every request, from shopping choices to reserving a table each night at one of Milan's best restaurants. ( Il Salumaio di Montenapol, Il Coriandolo and Da Giacomo were wonderful choices). They were so helpful and professional and deserve to be commended. The breakfast (not included) was served in the restaurant which had beautiful views while eating a somewhat limited assortment, but hey, who wants to take time eating when there is so much shopping to do?? Our room was like sleeping in the latest Armani suit-all the famous Armani colors amidst lighting and music which could be controlled and dimmed via an Ipad... of course. I mean... this is Armani! We did not, however have a view with our standard room, but I am sure most other rooms do. Let's talk bathroom. Absolutely breath-taking! Almost as big as the bedroom. Armani products (full size) and cushiony bath towels that are plush enough for pool-side. Oh .. yes. The pool... On the rooftop with a glass enclosure to see the sun/moon as you swim. Pure, pure heaven. If I can think of only ONE thing which stood out the most at this fabulous hotel, it would be the kindness and sincerity of everyone working at the hotel. Each beautiful Armani employee took the time to talk to you and ask if there was anything they could do to make our stay more perfect. Thank you again. We will return. Bravo!"

On my last trip to Milan, I could not resist treating myself again to a massage and a couple of hours to escape the cold of the coming winter sitting in the jetpool or beside it while sipping on a green tea. My favorite is the individual saunas and steam rooms. You can sit in your personal sauna while looking out over Milan's beautiful rooftops! It's an incredible and unique way to unwind."

366322446,April 2016,5.0,"Exceptional Service, comfort and convenience","We had one night in Milan after 3 enjoyable days in Lake Como and chose this hotel for a final night. From the booking to the checkout, the service was flawless. We arrived early but our room was ready and we were escorted and shown to our room on the 6th floor and the ""IPad"" controls for the entire room. Stunning views from our balcony over Milan to the Duomo, and probably one of the best nights sleep I've had in a longtime. The bed was so comfortable, the luxury Armani toiletries, robes, bathroom and the ""quirky"" two way mirror in the toilet! Beautifully designed to Armani contemporary style. The concierge made dinner and lunch reservations for us very efficiently and I've not known such friendly doormen, who cannot help you enough. Not cheap, but what is at this level of luxury -  4 gin and tonics ‚Ç¨100! One thing I noticed was the predominately middle eastern guests, as it's run by a middle eastern company with links to the Dubai hotelif you are looking for a short stay in an uber cool hotel, try this."
361753005,March 2016,4.0,Good but not great!,"The hotel is very stylish and the staff helpful, however there are few negatives I would want to highlight. First, we came by car and used the valet parking. The parking is however used by the hotel is few hundreds meters away and it thus take about half an hour to get your car! Not very practical, especially when the service is charged 65‚Ç¨ per night. The SPA is the second major issue we faced. Indeed, the SPA area is way too small for the size of the hotel. In fact there are less than 10 seating spaces (only 5 deckchairs!) in the entire SPA.  We tested the NOBU restaurant which is within the establishment and weren't disappointed. Overall, the experience is pleasant and stylish but could easily be improved by some reorganization."

My favorite though is the bathroom, so modern and sophisticated! The mini bar is complimentary, and they have delicious chocolate dragees. There's a Nespresso machine as well as complimentary tea.The bed is extremely comfortable, yet you can also choose from the pillows' menu in case you were a picky sleeper.Overall, one of my favorite luxury hotels in Europe, and definitely our ""home"" when in Milan!"
353230687,February 2016,4.0,Posh Modern Minimalism,"Every town has its signature.  In paces to go , in things to do , in the hotel to stay.Place to stay in Milan is definitely Armani. Luxuries hotel in modern minimalism style equipped with the best facilities. It was our first time in Armani Hotel Milano and we chose hotel to stay because of its best location closest to shopping and fashion venus as our visit to Milan was due to fashion week. Room is high tech equipped operated by Ipad, very well protected from any noise from outside, silky paper walls, plus  minimum colors for calmness and eyes relaxation. Everything in the room had what was fitting our needs, It‚Äôs a  Quite, comfy and private oasis in the middle of the city.  Bathrooms are bigger than average 5*hotels in Europe. Restaurants offering healthy, fresh and organic food. Cant compare with Dubai Armani‚Äôs restaurant where staff are not that detailed to the guests and hardly speaking English. Hopefully Dubai will improve to the Milan Armani level. As any spa of Armani Hotel it has its outstanding view to the city through all-glass window,  with big Jacuzzi and single use sauna and steam bath. The only what was missing - is the beauty salon but guest services helped us to book our needful services outside the hotel. Plus the hairdresser can be called in the room.The staff is very helpful , knowledgeable with professional and  friendly  attitude for every request. I would like to highlight attentive assistance of Veronica Sprio and Claudia Gaudino. Thank you for making our stay comfortable and relaxing."

347303112,February 2016,5.0,Lifestyle Team and Luxury Touches,"Although I doubt the Armani Hotel regularly has families with young children visiting it's well appointed rooms, their Lifestyle Experience Team is to be complimented for its incredible efficiency and caring attitude for every request - from cars with booster chairs to nearby shops selling diapers to child friendly but good restaurants.  Virtually every request before the trip was answered within hours, and no task was too large from the moment we checked in.  Previous reviewers have noted the generous toiletries, designer furnishings, and stylish atmosphere.  The combination of great service and luxury touches, with zero snobbishness and plenty of affection for young (3 and 5) guests was seriously impressive - high recommendation for anybody worried about finding la vita dolce with bambini in tow."

344903141,January 2016,5.0,Elegant and contemporary,"I recently stayed at the Armani Hotel on business and felt already very special from the moment I walked in through the descrete entrance on the ground floor. After checking in, my Lifestyle Manager escorted me to my deluxe room and showed me how to personalise it from my fingertips with the room's ipad.¬† Just before dinner I pampered myself in the lavish, all-glass spa on the eight floor where the big jacuzzi and the single use saunas and steam baths guarantee privacy and intimacy with a top view of the city. Once in the bar, I was amazed by the elegant decor, the top notch furniture and the healthy food and drinks selection. The day after started with a workout overlooking Milan's rooftops. Following an intimate breakfast and a full morning of meetings, the fish rag√π spaghetti and the tuna tartare gave justice to the Michelin starred Armani restaurant. In a blink of an eye it was already time for checkout. Quick lift to the ground floor and I was back to the hussle and bussle of the city.¬†Arrivederci Armani Hotel Milano!¬† ;)"

342528886,November 2015,5.0,The only hotel to stay in Milan.,"I'm lucky to have travelled and stayed at so many luxury hotels and the Armani Hotel sets a new benchmark to refined hospitality.Mr.Armani has spared no attention to detail. From the moment you walked into the ground hallway to the ""As"" stamped on each individual sugar cube, everything has the Armani signature on it. The decor is what you'd expect from Giorgio Armani, a very distinct yet modern feel to luxury. If you like what he does with clothes and home furnishings, you will like it here. ( Speaking of which, you can purchase any of the Armani furniture you see at the hotel ..if you so desire.) In some areas especially the lift and the corridors outside the hotel rooms, it really feels like being in a luxurious space ship. The rooms are AMAZING : 1. Each room has an iPad you can control your lights, blinds, order order room service, play mood music (exclusive to the Armani hotel) or request a service.  2. Check out the pillow menu ! Because most of us have a very specific way of how we like our pillows. With all this attention to detail, It was very very hard indeed checking out of the hotel when we did.3. The hotel has a complimentary bar refilled daily . So as much soda, drinks, coffee and snacks as you can eat and drink that day for no charge and it get refilled in the evening. I frankly think all luxury hotel should follow this route - as you're already paying so much so why nickle and dime the guest?4. The toiletries are to die for. I've never been one of those people that take home hotel toiletries but the gorgeous nail files, shower caps, shower gels and soaps have such a luxe feel to them I cant help myself. And because housekeeping comes in two times a day, you can end up with quite a stash : )) Instant gifts for friends back home!5. The bathrooms are spacious, with a large bath tub overlooking the famous Via Manzoni, double his and hers sinks and heated floors. One of the other perks of staying here is access to an Armani makeup artist and.or a personal shopper to help you out shopping if the two stories of designer Armani clothing on the first two floors of this hotel ovewhelms you, and of course, priority reservations at both the Bamboo Lounge and Bar as well as the Michelin starred Ristorante Armani. Both the lounge and restaurant are destinations in themselves. The ristorante serves buffet breakfast in the mornings and its definitely a lavish spread.On one of the nights we were at the hotel, there were lines outside the hotel entrance to go into bar and I have to admit I felt a bit smug as I skipped passed the long lines of beautiful people as the doorman waved us inside with a ‚ÄúAhh, welcome back madam.‚ÄùThe spa ( which is important to me as a traveller) is housed on the top floor of the building, it‚Äôs the only large soaking pool I‚Äôve seen with floor-to-ceiling louvered windows and roof which make you feel as though you‚Äôre outside gazing at the spectacular view and the sky at the same time. Note I said soaking pool , not swimming pool. The hotel is so sought after during certain times like Milan Furniture Fair and Milan Fashion Week that sometimes, they have a minimum 5-day stay policy. Definitely on the list as one of my top hotels to stay in and THE hotel to stay in when one is in Milan."
341682801,January 2016,5.0,Lo mas fashion,"Disfrutando mis meeting en el Armani hotel con mis clientes..... Desde luego un hotel con mucho dise√±o, limpio y buena energ√≠a y fashion total,, aun era la fashion week! La tienda en la parte abajo, una maravilla y perfecto para hacer tus compras en plan relax,, buena musica y la presentaci√≥n inmejorable. Ademas se encuentra la parte a bajo un cafe que es mas casual que en el hotel y el servico muy profesional, ademas hay una zona para fumadores! Lo √∫nico que ha fallado en mi visita,, el servicio por la noche por tener demasiado gente y el personal era muy lento,, y por la ma√±ana para tomar un cafe, esperando 10 min, que finalmente hemos tenido irnos, por un evento de unos blogueros famosos... Y creo no me parece justo, ser cliente que gasta dinero y en mi caso, mi cliente ha aquillado la suite para unos d√≠as para un amigo, precio superar los 1.000‚Ç¨ la noche, y sentirnos que unos blogueros tienen mas importancia, que no gastan un duro que los propios clientes. Pero en si el hotel es una maravilla!"

339809759,January 2016,4.0,Excellent location and views,"The hotel is super modern and sleek. The staff is very kind and knowledgable. The hotel staff is also very welcoming, and the spa was great with excellent views. The location is amazing walking distance to best shopping in Milan as well as a few minutes from the centre and duomo of Milan. Next door in the same building you can eat at Nobu which was very good as well.Knocking off a star because it wasn't worth $900. Nice and really really modern but almost too modern. I think there are other hotels for half the price and just as or more luxurious in milan. You are really just paying for the name. The suite just gives you a very very small living area, but the bedroom and bath is the same."

332847661,December 2015,5.0,A WOW with some flaws,"This is a design hotel in its true sense of the meaning. I frankly admit that I absolutely love the style and the extreme attention gone into transferring the vision into reality. Its a 100% WOW.So if you like the theme and vibe you get from the website, you will not be disappointed. Breakfast is a real treat - and do not miss the gym/spa area. But, But, where ie the close by BVLGARI Hotel or Mandarin understands its all about the guests, again and again it was clear that the service level does not match the style of the ARMANI. Is it bad or rude? No, its just average, obviously with here and there I saw excellent service (Among best shoe shining job ever, Great doormen, sweet & kind cleaning staff). Being fair - I arrived to the ARMANI pretty much straight from an AMAN resort, which always is a tough test, but on the other side at an premise like the ARMANI Milano you wish the service to be up among there.I would still come back here - but my expectations for the service would be curved slightly."

The people are all incredibly helpful and warm, and totally pampered me from the moment I arrived.  The rooms are something else.  Heated bathroom floors. Well-stocked minibar where everything is included.  Even pull-out drawers for wine glasses!  And everything controlled by the iPad-- TV, temperature, lights, curtains.  Plus the location is absolutely perfect.  A 2 minute walk to the Duomo. Best window shopping anywhere. Just wonderful!  Can't wait to go back."
309102626,August 2015,4.0,Coolly sexy in the fashion district,"The Armani hotel is perfectly suited for its location - dead center in the middle of high-end shopping on Via Montenapoleone and an easy stroll to the Duomo cultural center.  My husband and I initially stayed at another hotel around the corner, but on a walk-about, the doorman at the Armani was so charmingly inviting he managed to coax us upstairs to the Bamboo lounge to enjoy a cocktail.  20‚Ç¨ for a martini (ouch!) was outrageous, but it was wonderful.  A tray of small tapas is served with your cocktail ‚Äì gratis.  Looking around at the other guests, it was obvious we were in a ‚Äòdesigner‚Äô hotel‚Äì women elegantly dressed with top-dollar shoes & purses, men in tailored suites and fine Italian leather loafers.  We certainly weren‚Äôt dressed for the Armani as we were on a casual walk-about, but we were never made to feel uncomfortable as we nibbled and drank.  However, I must note that, intentional or not, the Armani is not meant for the ‚Äòcasual‚Äô type or those with kids in tow ‚Äì be warned.The location of the lounge area, right at the skyline, was perfect for a view over the fashion district, straight out to the business district.  The ambiance is essentially a city hotel in granite, limestone, chrome, with soft neutral touches ‚Äì greige upholstery, white table clothes, etc‚Ä¶  The bathrooms in the Bamboo lounge are so high-fashion in black granite, I couldn‚Äôt find the soap, or distinguish where the mirror ended and walls/floor began ‚Äì note to designers‚Ä¶ ease up on the lux gimmicks, lighting is actually more important ‚Äì geez.  In any case, a few Chinese Whisper martinis later, my husband and I decided to relocate to the Armani hotel for the ‚Äòexperience‚Äô. The rooms are equally fashionable and coolly sexy - hand-held controls for all room functions, crisp linens, fluffy bathrobes and all the other accompaniments expected from a hotel at this level - fine toiletries, coffee service, minibar, and daily turn-down service with sweet treats.  But ladies, bring a hand-held mirror for make-up application - you‚Äôll need to sit at the window as the bathroom lighting is horrible (see note above to hotel designers).  Negatives (aside from my lighting pet-peeve):  The internet is slow and spotty (the norm in Milan in my experience); the overall ambiance and design is so fashionably minimalist that it lacks personality (honestly, how many shades of greige are there?) and warmth (this is not the place for romantic canoodling); a fairly basic breakfast buffet; and if you‚Äôre a technophobe, good luck with the gadgets.   The staff was helpful if a bit chilly ‚Äì but that‚Äôs almost expected given the hotel‚Äôs location in the heart of the fashion district in business-centric industrial Milan.  By the way, that lovely warm scent wafting all through the hotel is, according to the doorman, specially formulated incense - they really ought to bottle that!And now, the ultimate assessment ‚Äì would I return to Armani?  That depends ‚Äì for business or a long weekend of shopping and nightlife, sure.  But on a vacation seeking romance, no ‚Äì I would stop by the Armani for the cocktails and people-watching, but lay my head someplace ‚Äòwarmer‚Äô."

Ci √® stata riservata la VIP Lounge, che consente di apprezzare un panorama mozzafiato del Duomo e del Centro di Milano. Sapiente la gestione dei trattamenti, che vengono consigliati per rispondere alle esigenze del cliente. Una piccola ma fondamentale valutazione sanitaria all'ingresso (che raramente viene richiesta) evita esperienze spiacevoli o che in qualche modo possano turbare il trattamento. All'arrivo in SPA viene consegnato un set che comprende accappatoio e ciabattine, mentre asciugamani e teli sono a ""libero servizio"". La biancheria √® qualcosa di speciale: il tessuto √® molto spesso e morbido. Un rapido spuntino, gustato sempre in SPA, convince a provare il ristorante.

303739532,August 2015,3.0,Can't say much...,"When we entered the hotel it was like entering in the world of armani. We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights..hotel is amazing interior wise service wise but there are a few things that were a problem firstly the spa was very nice when we entered but wen the treatment was actually done it did not meet my expectation and when I told my therapist she told me that I should get it done from a male therapist which I believe is very rude because in our country women do not get their therapies done from men. Secondly, now let's come to the rooms the bed was making a weird noise everytime while turning during sleep which was not so pleasent and noise from neighbouring rooms of d bell used to come into our room which was on the 5th floor..and lastly the shower in the bathroom wasn't working properly but when we complained the problem was rectified.

301273050,August 2015,1.0,Expected more from Armani,"Very disappointed.  I booked at this hotel because the room description was ""Kitchen with refrigerator, cookware/dishware and espresso maker"".  We needed a kitchen; we got a small counter, with a minibar fridge and an expresso machine.  No sink, no cooking utensils, nothing to use to heat the food. Not exactly a lie but certainly not the truth. I was naive enough to think that Armani would not exaggerate like this.Additionally, the lobby is on the 7th floor.  To get to your room you need to take one elevator to the lobby and switch elevators to go to your room.  Very annoying to have to take 2 elevators every time you go in our out of your room."
299754007,August 2015,4.0,Beautiful location but,One has to love armani's ambiance to be totally at ease in this perfectly located but a little gloomy all grey decor. Desk personnel and Doormen are very friendly and helpful. C minus for breakfast service and hostess. Restaurants were closed due to holidays so testing was not possible.
298331001,June 2015,5.0,Elegant Hotel at a reasonable price,It is one of the coolest and hippest hotel I have visited. It is situated at the shopping hub. The location is fabulous. I only paid 510 Euros for my room(prepaid). All furnishings and toiletries are by Armani. I happen to bring along a Armani jacket and the fabric looks almost like the bedspread :) The rooms at the lower floors can be noisy because of road traffic. So request a high floor if you want to be quiet.

294672220,July 2015,5.0,Fantastic!,"This is our second stay at the Armani in Milan.It is exceptional in every way.While it has a much younger and trendier feel than its peers -- the FS, Park Hyatt, the new MO we assume, and maybe even the Bulgari, nothing is sacrificed in terms of service.It is refreshing to see a ""design"" property with zero attitude -- on the contrary, everyone makes you feel at home, caters to your every need with the utmost kindness and in general make you feel like they truly care about ensuring you have a great stay. And we did.We we were upgraded to a Premier room with a balcony, which was super comfortable, complimentary mini bar is a really nice touch.  Bathroom amenities (Armani of course) are the best.  Ipad control is great and easy to use.Location could not be better.  We are truly grateful to the entire team for another great stay and look forward to returning.  A special thank you to Kladis at reception (sorry for the likely misspelling) who is the most generous and pleasant customer service professional we have ever encountered.We hope Armani is considering expanding its hotel chain..."

290438256,July 2015,4.0,Very Good but something just missing,My wife and I with our 20 year old daughter stayed for one night in July.  The check in staff were very friendly and helpful and both rooms were very good although the room we were in there were some evidence of small wear and tear.  The service in the bar where we tried to have a pre dinner drink was downright bad and in the end we didn't have time to properly enjoy a quiet drink before dinner.My wife and daughter had treatments in the spa which they both enjoyed and the gym was good.The location of the hotel is fantastic and it is very good but relative to other premium end hotels we have used there was something missing.  We are not sure we would come back.
288771993,July 2015,5.0,Viaggio romantico,Abbiamo vinto un week end romantico e lo staff dell'hotel √® riuscito a renderlo indimenticabile. Siamo stati accolti dal personale dell'hotel con cordialit√† e rispetto... persone veramente fantastiche. Al pomeriggio abbiamo fatto il massaggio in spa. Molto professionali e bravi. (Devo ringraziare la massaggiatrice ke m ha fatta sentire in paradiso) poi c hanno portato in una stanza con champagne e fragole. E ci hanno accompagnato alla piscina. Arriviamo in suite bellissima confortevole da sogno. Alla sera siamo andati al ristorante pietanze prelibate e curate nel dettaglio. La colazione abbondante e varia. Luoghi arredati con gusto e veramente eleganti

280172607,June 2015,4.0,Nice hotel not worth the money,"Good: Amazing hotel in terms of staff and interior. Very chic. Room is bigger than expected. Very clean. Bad:The room is too dark. Its too expensive When we first arrived the elevtor was not working so we had to take the stairs to the 7th floor which was exhausting!! They asked if we'd like to drink something and I only asked for water after the journey I took on the stairs I thought it would be complementary but No they charged me for it!! I booked a session at the spa, the therapist was 10 minutes late. I was stuck in a room waiting for her. The massage was awful. And on top of that she did not finish the session it was less than 50 minutes which was the agreed time. Overall I enjoyed my stay but there were some negative points and I hope it gets better."

Camere meravigliose, dotate di tutti i comfort, iper tecnologiche (I-pad che comanda tutto, dal clima alle tende, dalla luce alla tv, dall'apriporta con videocamera alla lettura dei quotidiani.Per non parlare delle lenzuola, dei teli da bagno, delle ciabattine e dell'accappatoio, tutto firmato Armani.E poi la linea di cortesia, creata appositamente per gli ospiti dell'hotel che richiama l'inconfondibile e storico profumo Armani Priv√®.Personale cortese e preparato, sempre disponibile per qualsiasi necessit√†.Minibar sempre rifornito, per non parlare delle ""dolcezze gastronomiche"" dello Chef che trovi in camera all'arrivo.Esperienza sensoriale eccezionale che trova il suo apice appena entri in hotel, ai piani, nella camera: l'inconfondibile profumo che ti ricorda che sei da Armani (come nei negozi e boutique) e il famoso profumo di cui sono innamorato e non posso fare a meno. Il mio profumo, il profumo che uso e che sento anche in casa mia.Prima volta ma di certo non ultima.Grazie a tutto lo staff e al Signor Armani che ha concepito tutto questo."

BENE. Ottimo segno di attenzione al cliente.Che dire poi del pranzo, grandissimo Gourmet ! Mi avevano parlato bene dello chef Gozzoli, cos√¨ ho pensato che Pasqua potesse essere la buona occasione per provare. INCREDIBILE !! LO definirei il guru dell' UMAMI ! Davvero. Non aggiungo altro ... semplicemente PROVATE !!!!Ancora una volta sono stato colpito dall'atmosfera, la pulizia e la grande professionalit√† del personale. Eccellenti i vini e anche un buon rapporto qualit√† prezzo.Sul resto non ho molto da aggiungere. Sempre al Top ! Ho avuto ancora il piacere di poter chiacchierare con il manager dell'Hotel, il Sig.

250396364,January 2015,5.0,"Ottima struttura, sotto tutti gli aspetti!","Viaggio spesso per lavoro e alloggio in molte strutture alberghiere. Devo dire che all'Armani Hotel ho trovato un ottimo ambiente: accoglienza eccellente (sia alla porta che al ricevimento), sorriso sincero e professionalit√† d'alto livello. La camera √® stata una sorpresa: domotica accessibile e funzionale, stile moderno ma accogliente, il bagno non come semplice accessorio ma come parte funzionale e piacevole della stanza. Rifornimento frigobar senza riserve e l'idea della macchina del caff√® a cialde molto gradita. Letto comodissimo e possibilit√† di riposo assicurato. Per non parlare della colazione: ampia scelta fra continental e American (i pancake sono squisiti!) con prodotti di livello, personale disponilissimo e pronto anche alle esigenze del bimbo (ero li con moglie e figlio di circa un anno e mezzo), immancabile il sorriso di tutti e spettacolare la vista che viene offerta dalle ampie vetrate. Top della gamma, personale e struttura da 10 e lode. Complimenti!"

Particolarmente bella la jacuzzi (e la vista). la vista in realt√† √® bella da qualsiasi punto dell'albergo, dal bar, dal ristorante e dalle camere, sempre luminose. Ottimo anche il ristorante del 7 piano, ottima qualit√† e servizio. sicuramente impegnativo come cifre sia il ristorante che l'hotel ma ne vale assolutamente la pena."

The only good point about this hotel is its great location.Will not come back in the future."

192217768,January 2014,5.0,Grazie signore Armani!!!!!,"The hotel is in one word sensational!!!!!I've visited this city many times and i've stayed in Park Hyatt,Bulgari,Townhouse Galleria....This was my first visit to Armani hotel and i had some doubts because of some negative reviews in trip advisor.My first impression wasn't very positive because i was a little confused about the seventh floor lobby. The second thing was the smell of the hotel.It was very strong.At first i didin't like it at all but after a couple of hours i was addicted to it!!!!!I loved it!!!!the room was absolutely perfect!!!!perfect bed perfect pillows,perfect sheets.....the remote control for everything was very convenient...the walk in closet was spacious,the mini bar was free(soft drinks and snacks)The big hit was the bathroom.....OMG...big with a fantastic bathtube separate cabin shower all with marbles!!!!i loved the fact that the floor was heated!!!What can i say about the Armani prive amentities the Armani towels....Also there was no noise at all....it was perfect for relaxation...In our short stay we had a small issue...our safe deposit had a problem and it was blocked.We telephoned the reception and at once they solved our problem.Miss Anja was a very sweet and helpful lady .She apologised and after acouple of minutes we were treated Armani deserts in our room..After that she called us and she made for us a reservation at Armani bamboo bar!!!!we were treated as VIP....and that was a surprise for us....many thanks Anja !!!!!!!!What can i say...We will definetely come back.It combines minimal luxury perfect location and excellent service!!!Grazie signore Armani"
183137613,October 2013,5.0,5* Experience worth the money,"We spent 5 nights in a premier room, they gave us a room on the 6th floor with a very nice balcony looking over the cathedral, fantastic viewOur room was prepared as requested, with the baby bed ready in the room, even the temperature was set to exactly to 22 as requested !The beds & the towels were very clean and high quality,The bathroom was fantastic, and amenities were absolutely superbDefiantly 5 star experience"
174556539,August 2013,5.0,The most amazing bar -- An experience to remember,"Two of us had four of the most exceptional Mohitos on the planet. Delicious and beautifully prepared. The atmosphere is HIP. The staff attentive. The aperitifs memorable. The views are exceptional. Yes, it is expensive, but that seems to fit the experience."
165486546,June 2013,5.0,"Good location for shopping, but very modern",This hotel has one of the best locations for shopping. They don't have personalized luxury service and their style is ultra modern. but it is different than other real Italian hotels and might be nice to try.
162174654,May 2013,3.0,a lot for nothing,"i really did not appreciate my stay at this hotel for the following reasons :1- when you arrive to the hotel for check-in, you must take a lift to the 7th floor where reception is, once you finish check-in and to go to your room you need to cross the 7th floor to catch the lift for rooms, come down again to floors 2,3,5 where rooms are located. so if you are just out the hotel and you forget something in your room, it takes you almost 10 minutes to get it ( 7 floors up, cross the reception area, wait for the second lift, go down again 4 or 5 floors, get to your room, AND THE WAY BACK.2- I asked to have my diner the hotel restaurant on the 7th floor, SORRY the resaurant is booked for a special event, we can serve you in your room ( nice one ) finally the concierge succeeded to find me a place in a restaurant near the hotel ( after trying 2 others and could not obtain a place, that's unusual for high standard hotel )3- breakfast is light and you have to wait for a while to find the hostess and to place you, after my breakfast i asked for an espresso in the smoking lounge ( in front of the restaurant ) after i waited more than 10 minutes without being served, i went to the hostess and told her that i did not get my coffee, and i do not have more time to wait, so please cancel it , she said only one word : OK4- rooms are well equipped but you can hear and feel the tramway of via manzoni each time it pass under your window.for the same range of price, you can have a much better room and service, unless you want to try it for once."
159629933,May 2013,2.0,Could have been much better....,We stayed recently at the hotel. The location is great - right where you want to be if you are in Milan to do some shopping.... The hotel is well appointed...although the decor is not for everyone... so please check out the hotel photos before booking... The service is terrible...We waited for a very long time to get our bags delivered to the room - although I have asked to have them delivered urgently as I was late for a meeting. We waited for 25 minutes... Our room had a terrible smell...I suspect the previous guest was keeping raw fish in the closet... The breakfast buffet is expensive and very limited. When we got to breakfast in the morning it was very busy and not much of a selection was left... The stuff was very slow and we had to ask for our coffee/tea a number of times... I would not stay there again. The Four Seasons is much better but it was fully booked so we could not stay there and ended up in Armani. Nobu is located in the same building and its great...
155053659,March 2013,5.0,Unforgettable experience,We have just stayed 4 nights at the hotel and we had the most amazing experience of our lives. The service is perfect and the staff is friendly and helpfulThe atmosphere is elegant and stylishThe rooms are very comfortable and cozy. You really feel at homeThe Spa is really nice and relaxing and the location is just perfectBreakfast and dinner at Armani Hotel are excelent and we recommend.Bamboo Bar is also worth a visit at any time you are in Milan.Just be aware that Nobu Armani is not part of the hotel. We were not aware of that and asked the concierge to book a table at Nobu Armani and we deeply regret it.Our dinner at Nobu Armani was one of the worst experiences of our lives regarding quality and service and we recommend to avoid this restaurant if you do not want to spoil your stay in Milan.It is really a shame that such a bad restaurant is allowed to bear the name Armani
154967250,March 2013,5.0,... man muss sich auch mal was g√∂nnen!,"... nach 15 jahren mailand-abstinenz endlich mal wieder design + fashion live erleben. tja, nur welches hotel? etliche tripadvisor-foristen haben das anvisierte STRAFF madig gemacht. vom ARMANI hatte ich schon einiges gelesen. aber der preis! als hotelfreak musste es nun doch sein, da die lage unschlagbar ist. also, online gebucht, eingetreten und in der 2. etage gelandet, der netten empfangsdame irgendetwas von ""fotografo"" und ""panoramico"" geradebrecht. sie telefonierte kurz und begleitete uns in die 6. etage und war selbst erfreut, dass sie uns ein upgrade-zimmer (# 640) geben konnte, mit 180¬∞ blick bis in die alpen. ich kann verstehen, dass einigen foristen das hotel zu wenig gem√ºtlich war. aber ist georgio armani ein ""gem√ºtlicher"" designer? zum gl√ºck nicht! man mag bem√§ngeln, dass die korridore etwas klaustrophob sind, aber auch das ist wiederum design. unser zimmer war bis ins kleinste detail gestaltet und durchdacht. grand-lit, bettw√§sche, duvets, kissen etc. vom besten. geradezu state-of-the-art das bad, mit separater dusche, sowie wc und bidet. kleines manko: nur ein waschbecken, aber das schm√§lert den gesamteindruck nicht. witzig: das entr√©e mit halbrunder schiebet√ºre. auf knopfdruck via entertainement-fernbedienung: vertikale und horizontale fensterstores. der √ºbergrosse flatscreen-tv versenkbar in einer kommode. alkoholfreie minibar √† discretion. zumindest bei winter- und regentage fehlte jedoch ein zweiter sessel. um sich entspannt mal auszuruhen. wir hatten jedoch eine schmale terrasse √ºber die gesamte zimmerbereite mit flechtsesseln, leider war es dazu zu kalt. restaurant und (fr√ºhst√ºcks-)bar haben wir nicht in anspruch genommen, nicht wegen deren coolness, sondern weil vor der hotelt√ºre in laufweite das italienische caffetteria-leben auf uns wartete. mein besonderer tipp: 100m rechts vom ARMANI, die bar des GRAND HOTEL ET DE MILAN. mehr old fashiond stil f√ºr einen aperitivo finden sie in mailand wohl kaum."
149553904,December 2012,5.0,Best Hotel in Milan,"Myself and my wife have visited Milan many times always staying at the Hyatt. The last time we decided to try Armani. I am so glad we booked this hotel. I was slightly concerned, having read some reviews but thankfully our stay was excellent. We brought my parents for their first trip to Italy and their experience of Milan hospitality started when we arrived. Both rooms allocated were very clean and stocked with fab Armani products and a complimentary MiniBar. The beds and pillows were extreemely comfortable. The heating control system was easy to manage and rainfall shower heads and plenty of hot water was just right to get us revived after our journey.  There was free wi-fi access in lounge and in each room.We have no complaints regarding noise and our view (5th floor) was very nice.I ALWAYS read reviews on trip advisor before I book and if a hotel is not to my satisfaction I am very quick to write a review. I am hard to please regarding customer service and I have no complaints. It is only fair to also give credit where credit is due. Thank you Armani staff for making our trip a wonderful experience. We will be back and I will be recommending my friends to stay also. Thank You."
147411065,December 2012,3.0,Servizio inesperto e distratto,"Per essere un hotel 5 stelle Lusso il personale √® troppo giovane ed inesperto. Sono spesso distratti (non sono riuscito a bere un te per colazione, stavo per partire senza bagaglio...). Non possiamo fare neanche lontanamente un paragone con l'hotel Principe di Savoia dove, a meno spesa ti senti un re."

144441382,July 2012,5.0,Esperienza emozionale,Consigliato davvero a quelle persone che hanno bisogno di staccare la presa per qualche giorno. Ambiente comodo e rilassante anche grazie al servizio di spa che comprende bagno turco sauna piscina palestra docce e massaggi. Servizio ristorazione eccellente e personale molto disponibile e gentile. Assolutamente dovr√≤ tornarci!
142888700,September 2012,5.0,"Armani, sempre affascinante","La posizione centralissima, di fronte a via Montenapoleone, lo rende ideale per visitare la citt√†. E' il posto ideale per lo shopping: tutto il meglio di Milano √® intorno, a 2 passi. L'ingresso √® un po' buio, un po' modesto, non da Armani. Ma quando entri ti innamori. Si vede la classe e l'eleganza in ogni angolo. Servizi e personale eccellenti. Dentro l'albergo √® bellissimo, originale e curato. Giorgio Armani √® sempre un grande, un esempio da seguire."
142754297,October 2012,5.0,Impressive a tutti gli effetti,"Having just opened in the last 10 months, my wife and I decided when in Milan to give it the once over.We arrived by car from Lugano and the doorman opened the door and then the hotel's double doors. On entering the lobby we noticed the fragrance in the air called bois d'incense and the minimalist interiors and were directed to the 7th floor and were greeted by Antonio who gave us a warm welcome and offered us a small tour of the Hotel.Sheila and Barbara, assisted us in choosing our dinner reservations, which were beautifully served.The spa also on the top floor is a paradise!"
141307218,September 2012,5.0,spettacolare,"Straordinaria esperienza all'Armani Hotel. Ho soggiornato in una premier room e che dire, e' stata un 'esperienza perfetta. Camera enorme, curata in ogni dettaglio, pulita, accoglienza cortese e professionale. Rimessa a punto prima della notte con sostituzione di asciugamani e rinnovo degli amenity da bagno (bagnoschiuma e crema da corpo in formato 150 ml!!!)Bagno bellissimo ed enorme, cabina armadio molto utileFrigobar fornitissimo (analcolici) e gratuito, macchina per espresso in camera. Ci tornero' spesso"
139880775,September 2012,5.0,Che esperienza meravigliosa!!!,Non sono mai stata accolta cos√¨ calorosamente in vita mia come all'armani hotel Milano!!!Ho soggiornato nei primi giorni di settembre e malgrado l'hotel fosse super busy il servizio che mi e' stato dato e' stato degno di lodePartendo dal piano zero dove dei ragazzi super eleganti ti danno il benvenuto con tutto rispetto fino ad arrivare al lifestyle managers credo si chiamassero Lina e Antonio. Ogni mia richiesta e' stata esaudita in tempi brevissimi!!! Adoro lo stile armani e da oggi amo ancora di pi√π il suo mondo! Torner√≤ sicuramente presto.
136637875,August 2012,5.0,Armani says it all,"Beautiful hotel. Staff were very accommodating and helpful, and lifestyle manager team always very helpful. The room was equally impressive. Nice little terrace, very large room with beautiful bathroom with lovely Armani products. I must comment of the general smell around the hotel. Its not something i woukd generally comment on, but it just smelt so darn good everytime i stepped into the hotel and my room! Location was also great for exploring Milan and of course... Shopping! My room rate also included free minibar which was a lovely touch with plenty to choose from.When i was looking for somewhere to stay in Milan, i was tossing up between Bulgari and Armani, but am glad i chose Armani! Would i stay again? Yes! And will recommend it to all my friends (who can afford it of course)"
133729364,July 2012,4.0,"Great hotel, good to excellent service, quirky design","Checked in for two nights. This is hotel is not for everyone, it's very high tech and I could see some clients get mad trying to figure it out. The hotel is less than a year old but over all the experience was a positive one. Our front desk agent/concierge or as they call them ""lifestyle manager"" was really good and attentive. Quick check in, on to our room where he gave us a perfect explanation of the room and how to use the technology. Dinner at Nobu (very good, like any other Nobu), great night sleep, relaxing at the spa, etc... here's my breakdown. Love- very well designed and built- staff was wonderful everywhere within the hotel- gorgeous spa/gym and views from the 7 and 8th floors- bed and linens were very comfortable- complementary snacks and water/sodas in the minibar, refreshed daily- the nespresso machine in the room- Armani Prive bath products- spa and pool, with private steam/sauna. Really relaxing with complementary juices/teas- location, near everything- remote control that does everything from shades, ac, tv to even calling you lifestyle manager to the room. Hate- lit light switches in the room (I counted 4 different ones in the room alone), lights the entire room all night, had to prop up pillows in front of them every night. - as much as I love the fragrance they pump into the AC for the ground level entrance and certain other areas of the hotel, our floor (4th) hallways smelled like toilet deodorizer, gross- breakfast could be better in terms of menu, though the buffet has a lot to offer (minus any hot items)- I understand it is for security purpose but having to switch elevators to get from the room to the hotel exit via the 7th fl lobby can be annoying for some- 120 euros to transfer to the train station 5-10 minutes away... (we didn't use it and took a cab for 10 euros)"
131820536,November 2011,3.0,stylish decor with not much attentive service,"Sono stata per 2 notte subito dopo l'iaugurazione.Furniture/decor-- nothing to complain, spacious bathroom is extremely nice.All amenities are in black hence very much ""Armani"" ,even chips at mini bar has Armani logo!Jacuzzi & sauna are for both men& women together, so that you should never forget to bring your bathing suit when you stay here.Scarely doormen like bar bouncers..."
129992690,April 2012,5.0,SUPER,"Beautiful property in the heart of Milan's most fashionable area. Fresh, modern, elegant, essential and invigorating! Rooms tastefully furnished, functional and above all quiet, very spacious with a large marble bathroom, two sinks and separate shower from the tub, courtesy of the products are unique in their kind. Impeccable service. Beautiful top floor of the SPA with views over the rooftops of Milan and the Duomo. Restaurants and bars louge really COOL! Definitely one of the best addresses in Milan"
127126333,March 2012,2.0,Pay more. Expect less.,"You get what you pay for. In Armani Hotel Milan though.... you get nothing more than a nicely designed hotel with exquisite materials and top notch fittings or details.But is that all that makes a great hotel? Would it be the Design or the Experience?I don't care how rich Armani expects his guests to be. If you charge more, you have to give more. That's the basis of everything isn't it? For an average of EUR700 per night, the room doesn't even come with a free breakfast or even a welcome drink. They have not a bad mini bar which is freeflow and free but they first forgot the bottle opener and when they did remember, you'd realise it only opens the San Pellegrinos and not the smaller bottles.The toilet paper is rough like sandpaper. The overhead shower sprays onto the entrance of the shower cubicle so it was hard to adjust the temperature without first getting squirted on. They give you two phones (one on each side table) but they failed to take a reservation of a restaurant down properly. The automation remote control of the room is sophisticated but their TV is an LG, which did not seem to agree with the control to begin with. My air conditioning wasn't working and I found it strange they had to realise that only after I complained about it.Still on electrical and electronics, the hidden socket point under the writing desk is great but they have failed to realise they would be catering to the international travelers and their adapters? So forget about trying to charge your laptop while working on the table. Your adapters can't squeeze into the cavity that houses the sockets.Food wise, I would agree with everyone here who has given a nasty review on it. It sucks. Big time. The veal medalion was dry and tasteless (maybe its a Milan style) and the bread is served cold. The only thing they managed right, sparkling mineral water.A maintenance manager came telling me in the usual Italian mannerism that the pool was only opened from 9:30am to 9:30pm. I was there at 8am and the sign said 'Opened from 7:30am to 9:30pm'. He said 'no problem' after but that was a mood downer. There were three people using the pool. I guess he only fished the asian out to have his views imposed upon.In the end, this is a specially designed hotel. Just that it doesn't make their guests feel any more special. It's just a shame, everything is in place and they have done a great job with the design and branding but it just doesn't have that little extra something of an Aman or Six Senses venue. The hardware is all there but the software is completely lacking. A friendly and nice lifestyle manager (or in my case I do not know who was assigned to me) is always there to assist you but you'd give up asking after awhile. I hope the Dubai one is better. For the eagle's sake.ps: Armani if you're reading this... try providing free bicycles. It'll add to a better touch to your service levels. All nice with a basket and Armani labeled frames."
124178334,January 2012,5.0,Que mas puede uno esperar de Armani!!!!,"La primera imprsion al llegar al hotel es un poco rara, ya que su entrda es un vestibulo peque√±o, minimalista con un escritorio con un empleado con su elegante traje Armani. Al decir que estaba llegando me hicieron tomar el ascensor y subir al lobby al piso 7, al preguntar porque la razon de un lobby en el penultimo piso, la respuesta fue simplemente genial. es la manera de que los huespedes usen todos los rest, bares etc del hotel de una manera privada y tranquila, si desea ir a alguno de los bares o rest ubicados en otras partes de el hotel ellos muy amablemente los llevaran. Yo me quede en una suite, algo que me llamo la atencion es el dise√±o interno del hotel, sus pasillos forman una ""A"" de Armani, buen detalle de dise√±o. todo es minimalista y en colores neutros con mucho marmol y muchas piedras semipreciosas en las paredes de rest y bares. La Hab simplemente increible, con todo lo que necesite, un control inteligente que puede hacer de todo desde su cama, desde luces, sonido, cortinas, room service, asistente personal y pare de contar.La comida es simple pero muy buena en lo que a almuerzos se refiere.Es bastante costoso el Hotel, pero por su genial Hubicacion y darse ese gusto de disfrutar un lugar tan relajante y divino, vale la pena mimarse de vez en cuando"
123638924,July 2011,5.0,Love! Love! Love!,"Loved everything about my experience at this hotel, you feel the calming effect of the property the minute you step foot inside leaving the city behind. We booked our stay through a company called HOM Vacation and was not disappointed. After only a few emails, our trip was booked and planned. They set up a historical tour through the city which I highly recommend as well as the hotel spa. Milan is a serious shopping city so come prepared to explore and splurge. My only complaint was both the hotel and the city are very pricey. The service was also excellent as we were greeted and looked after by our ""lifestyle manager"" when we checked in and they made sure we were comfortable and happy throughout our trip. Amazing city, amazing property."

La location √® sprepitosa, come pure lo stile e gli arredi. Cena da 10 e lode! Sia per quanto riguarda il servizio sia sotto il profilo culinario. Invece sono rimasta molto delusa dal servizio e dalla qualit√† del the pomeridiano...cameriere inesperto, attesa molto lunga, stoviglie inappropriate...cioccolata meglio quella fatta in casa....diciamo che il settore bar a mio parere deve migliorare parecchio, tenendo conto anche del fatto che i prezzi sono ovviamente sopra la media."

My phone didn't but I've also used my Surface in many hotels, so who knows. I alerted the reception and they said they will call the technician but nothing happened. I couldn't use my laptop much during the last 12 hours or so of my stay. I would get WiFi for 15-30 min and then it will cut out for few hours - it almost felt like it was throttling me."

714561919,September 2019,5.0,Completely perfect,"My boyfriend and I spent 3 nights at the Armani Hotel during our stay in Milano. We were truly blown away from start to finish. You get exactly what you pay for- every penny was worth this experience. The staff are attentive and every detail is just perfect. The room was fabulous- interior, layout beautiful and every element controlled via an iPad. You also get 15% off to use within the building, whether that be the restaurant, shop, room service etc which was definitely worth it considering we spent our final night in the Bamboo bar.The room specifications were sublime. The most stunning bedroom, bathroom and comfortable bed- you haven‚Äôt experienced luxury until you experience this hotel! The ONLY downside was the bath- it was a tiny tiny bath that just didn‚Äôt fit in with the rest of the bathroom. Not good enough for a hotel costing around ¬£600 a night. Other than that, amazing experience and will certainly visit another Armani Hotel."
709952849,September 2019,5.0,Excellent and memorable stay,I took my sister to visit Milan for her birthday and choose to stay at Armani Hotel. It was the best decision ever.

703359884,August 2019,5.0,A modern masterclass,Everything felt right about this hotel. The ambience was classic Armani. The valet parking team saved me a hefty fine from Milan council as I had totally missed the requirement to pay the Congestion Charge area (Area C) until I read about it 2 days later - but the hotel had already paid it for me when I asked them about it so thank you for that ! The business centre had everything one will need - projectors / internet etc The location was second to none - about 10 minutes from Milan Duomo Breakfast was the usual continental stuff.

679237009,June 2019,1.0,2 star service & property for a 7 star price,"We came here to celebrate my parents anniversary and it was the most terrible experience we had. Other than the fact that they didn‚Äôt seem to care about their guests, everything was worse than the next. The entrance lobby was so inconvenient, the elevator buttons had to be pushed real hard to get access. Our room was not well maintained. The bathroom had a very foul smell and the air conditioning wasn‚Äôt working. Despite our complains they were extremely rude & curt at all times. Even the water bottles were hard to use and it just felt like we are in a dingy, dull, unfriendly hotel. Please do not waste your money to come stay here, it will only spoil your mood & time. I wish I didn‚Äôt book this hotel and booked absolutely anything else in Milan. Highly disappointed & dissatisfaction with my stay."
678823640,May 2019,5.0,Grazie,"This modern hotel that looks like a bunker from the outside is a wonderful place to stay in Milan.  The bunker gives way to a modern and somewhat dark hotel but the rooms are spacious, comfortable and very chic.  We had a balcony room with a nice view and enjoyed not only the room but room service.  The overall service was very good and attentive.  The location is perfect and has easy access to shopping and the main sites in central Milan.  Though the hotel is a bit dark for my tastes it worked and overall this is a great hotel."

643824104,December 2018,5.0,One of life‚Äôs little luxuries,"We stayed in the standard room which was really impressive with its entrance and hallway to the room with walk-in wardrobe. The bathroom was large and luxurious and the heated floor was a lovely touch. The room was large and comfortable as you would expect with a gorgeous, comfy bed. But the real treat was a lovely, long balcony which was a nice sun trap, perfect for sitting out with a coffee. The other special touch we really enjoyed in the room was the complimentary mini bar and snacks, perfect for when you‚Äôre a little peckish before dinner. We used the pool which was lovely with great views of the city. The location was perfect with a metro station right outside and just a ten minute walk to the Duomo. Staff were friendly and helpful too."
641463866,December 2018,5.0,Perfect location,"Perfect location for shopping. Short walking distance to all the boutiques in Milan, and another 10 minutes walk to The Duomo. Our room was good size and nicely designed. My only reservation about this hotel is the access to go in and out of the hotel. The lobby is located on the 7th floor, while the rooms are on the floors below. The only way to get to your room is by taking the elevator to 7th, and change elevator to your floor. Same as when you wanna exit the hotel. Everything has to go through the 7th floor. Tried the food at The Bamboo Bar and was very disappointed."

Every request I had was handled swiftly, spa appointments, private guide, transportation transfers, restaurant reservations you name it. We had an executive suite that was very large, with 2 bathrooms. The in-room amenities were luxurious and plentiful. We were absolutely in love with our suite. Our room included a full breakfast (American style) with the option to order off an a la carte menu along with the buffet. We never felt the need because the provided buffet was so plentiful! Do not hesitate to book if you are looking for a luxurious sanctuary in an incredibly chic location in Milan."

Amazing staff that cannot do enough. Great location. We will return and there will only be one Hotel that we will be staying at- ARMANI"
602006681,July 2018,5.0,Fantastic stay!,"What an amazing experience! After a 28hour journey with a young baby, they had our room ready and waiting at 10.30 in the morning. The check in was the most helpful and pleasant experience i‚Äôve Had in any hotel in Europe. They showed us all the features of our room, gave maps and recommendations of places to go. A toy gift for our little one, and room upgrade! I can not fault the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff and the rooms were sleak and spotless. The location was also fantastic, being right at the start of via montenapoleone. We would stay here again without hesitation and if I could rate this hotel 6 stars out of 5 I would. It‚Äôs not the cheapest, but you get what you pay for! Thank you Armani hotel for a wonderful stay."
601588849,June 2018,5.0,"Smart, stylish and gracious","What a lovely surprise the Armani turned out to be. After staying in many lovely vintage hotels, the Armani was our last stop before heading home. We absolutely enjoyed the contemporary accommodations. It's a sleek and subtle: clean lines with a neutral palette of colors of varying textures ( back-lit amber, leather finished granite and plush towels and bedding).  The rooms are smart: everything is controlled by an i-pad. The staff was nice and accommodating, even remembering our names. The restaurant/lounge staff knew our choice of beverage after our first order. It's located on the 7th floor, so the floor to ceiling windows allow to appreciate the beautiful architecture surrounding the hotel.  I would definitely stay there again!"
601076421,July 2018,3.0,All Style and No Function,"Silly is the best description I can give. Beautiful rooms with nowhere to plug in anything. Cool elevators that are difficult to use. Large bathrooms where you can‚Äôt reach the TP because function was sacrificed in the name of style. Guests can be seen struggling to figure how to open their doors. Add a clueless surly staff and you get the picture. On a good note, room service was prompt and the lobby bar is nice if you don‚Äôt mind waiting 15 minutes for your drinks."

I got the classic suite which is supposed to be 60 sq m but it feels a lot smaller!!!  The room is so small there is not enough room to open two suit cases on the floor.  And what‚Äôs worse, there is a smell of mildew/mold in the shower.  Not what I was expecting for $1,000 usd per night.  Perhaps my experience will be better tomorrow. One more thing, i found a plastic cup full of cigarette butts on the terrace.  I guess the cleaning crew missed it"

577914085,May 2018,3.0,"A mix of 5 star and 4 star, dont be carried away with the brand!","That was my 3rd stay in armani milan. The first two stays was around 3 years back. I decided to stay in this hotel as I wanted to be close to Montenapoleone. However, first of all the checkin was average nothing special at all. I have booked a premium room category which is usually bigger than deluxe rooms. As it mentions on Armani website its 55sqm. However when i went to my room I was shocked how small the room is , then when i came back to reception to ask which category this rooms is, she told me its premium and i told her my previous stay the room was deluxe and was bigger! She gave me a very weird answer that only two rooms deluxe in the hotel that have a better layout! And she checked my room area and she told me its 47sqm and its big enough! I didnt want to argue as i was busy to attend a football match but i would say that was very disappointing and shocking. The room wasnt special at all. The hotel itself was dead. The same reception staff is the concierge and they have no clew about anything around town. I just regret not booking park hyatt milano as I did on new year eve."

What a classy touch!  We truly enjoy our daily breakfast at Armani Ristorante at the 7th Floor which always serves fresh and delicious breakfast items. All in all, Armani Hotel Milan not only deserves 5-star rating, but a serious contender for a 6-star rating (if there is any). Bravo!!"
556645663,November 2017,5.0,Amazing Armani,"Our stay at The Armani Hotel was in November 2017 for three nights.The hotel is as stylish as you would expect from Armani and situated in the heart of the glamorous shopping district. Our room was beautiful with a wonderful spacious bathroom and everything is controlled by iPad which is simple and fun to use. Quite often, when you stay in a nice hotel, you find yourself rolling your eyes when a bottle of water adds ¬£5 to your bill - not in the Armani hotel - there are many little complimentary touches that make your stay comfortable. But the best thing about the hotel is the staff! From the minute you arrive at the front door of the hotel, the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and really seem genuinely happy to help with anything. The gentlemen at the front door, the staff at reception and in the breakfast room were all amazing. On day two of our trip my Husband had to return to London for one night so I was on my own and I couldn't have felt more looked after with the staff noticing me looking at a map at breakfast and enthusiastically helping plan my day in Milan. We've been considering another short break somewhere else but I think that we might return to Milan - just to stay at The Armani Hotel.

539488530,October 2017,5.0,Unique Armani Experience,"My wife stayed at this hotel in October, as part of an anniversary trip. The hotel is very centrally located. It's close to the central train station, 5-10 minute walk to the Duomo and surrounded by many high-end and boutique shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is beautiful, modern, minimal and elegant at the same time. The staff was very friendly and helpful on making dinner reservations or area recommendations. We didn't get a chance to visit the restaurant, but had drinks and food in the room. Room service was excellent, very quick service and the food was still fresh when we received it. The room was a unique experience. They are super-modern, basically everything is controlled via in-room ipad. We found the ipad system to work great, very easy to use and had a great variety."

520343945,July 2017,5.0,"Superb, Sharp, Great Stay and Start to Our Trip","We had such a great stay at the Armani Hotel.  I would definitely go back.  The staff is friendly, attentive, and sharp.  We only stayed for one night at the beginning of our trip, but I wish we had had more time in Milan.  The views from our room of the city were wonderful, and everything in the room was smart/automated.  I literally raised and lowered the shades for fun...  This was the start of a second honeymoon trip, so we really appreciated the champagne and flowers!  The attention to detail was appreciated.  The Armani is a little more formal than we usually are - I kept wondering if I should dress a little sharper, and maybe I started to...?  No one honestly seemed to care.  They just smiled and asked what we needed.  This is a bit of a late review, but I am going back to do some reviews from this trip.  I think  my photos can help other travelers get a sense of this hotel.  I really think you won't be disappointed."
518749560,August 2017,5.0,Fantastic stay at Armani Hotel,"We chose Armani Hotel for the fantastic rating on online reviews, and it met and surpassed my expectations. The check-in was prompt and attention given to every detail, including hypo-allergenic pillows and comforters.  The porters were very prompt and courteous.The dinners at Bamboo Bar were very pleasant, with very tasty and beautiful dishes.  The highlight of the service was definitely the breakfast, which was included in the cost.  Andrea at the breakfast restaurant took great care of us. When I mentioned that due to my son's nut allergies, we were unable to taste any cakes that were on the breakfast buffet table, he promptly returned in a few short minutes with a beautiful freshly baked nut-free cake.  I have never had such caring service before. Clearly the hotel administration pick their staff carefully and it shows. I look forward to our next visit to this hotel!"
517170906,August 2017,4.0,Favorite hotel in Milano,"This was my second stay at the Armani hotel, and it was absolutely great. The rooms are very chic, fashionable, yet modern. The staff are very attentive and welcoming with the personalized attention that they give to each guest. However, there is one issue that needs improvement, and that is the cleaning of the rooms. My room was extremely dusty when I walked in, and I had to specify to the housekeeping that they do deep cleaning. This is the only reason I would give this hotel 4 stars instead of 5. Other than this issue, it is an excellent hotel that I highly recommend! I will definitely be returning. Sincerely,Michelle R. Safarian"

504791709,July 2017,3.0,"Very posh and Armani, but...","Great location.  Armani minimalist style and with Great view of the city from the lobby floor.  Highly recommended for proximity to shopping district.We were being ""upgraded"" to a Premiere Room which was located on the 2nd (lowest) floor and facing the courtyard.  It was the darkest room among all the places including museums we have visited during our entire trip in Italy!Everything in the room was controlled by an ipad.  It had everything one needed on hand with the exception of weather forecast of Milan.  From the two small windows looking out to the bushes in the courtyard we had to check weather from our smartphones.When we were being introduced to the room, the check in staff explained since the design of the hotel is minimalism, we do not see any sockets in the bathroom.  The hairdryer, she explained, is provided within one of the drawers under the sink.  The wire on the hairdryer which was connected to the drawer was so short, one could not have used it standing up.  You either have to bend down drying your hair or sit on the bathroom floor as there was no small chair that you can sit down on.We thought the hot water was not working until the shower water slowly warmed up after running for 5 mins.  Every single time we used the shower, we had to start the water running ahead of time.  At check out I did mention this to the hotel staff, who simply acknowledged this problem.There was very limited choice of TV channels except news and on demand movies.  When we visited it was the weekend of the Wimbledon Men's singles final.  There was not even one single sports channel we could find to watch the live game!"

499961559,July 2017,4.0,Armani visit - Milan,Gorgeous hotel but the rooms are a bit dark and possibly too tech driven for my taste.  I want to be able to turn on lights without having to go on an iPad.  There is more emphasis placed on the aesthetic than on the functional comfort.

485798689,March 2017,5.0,Awesome Armani,"Having stayed at the Armani in Dubai, we were keen on experiencing them in their home country. We weren't disappointed!The rooms and decor are fabulous; understated and luxurious in typical Armani style, good use of design, textures and colour schemes. Service was flawless, the hotel's bar and Michellin star restaraunt met all expectations and the gym and probably better than we a anticipated.The hotel is centrally, perfectly located and the fact it is above a large Armani store a bonus. The Japanese fusion restaraunt Nobu is also a benefit.We will definitely return to this property for our annual pilgrimage."

The service we outstanding, from the check in until the check out, and the staff was very attentive. The barman at the bamboo bar was very knowledgeable about the drinks and we enjoyed the aperitif very much before going for dinner in this superb hotel. The experience needs to be repeated. The room was also spectacular and superclean, and I was in love with the scent I noticed in the corridors. The cherry on top of all was the Spa and the facial treatment, with the most outstanding view over the city Milano. Well Done Armani and thank you!"

477083335,April 2017,5.0,Wonderful Stay in Milano,"The Armani Hotel Milano is a state of the art hotel. The rooms are spacious and actually very large for European standards. There are many features to the room that we loved. Heated bathroom floor, iPad controlled all room systems, free minibar, and modern decor. The design of the hotel was impressive (each floor is designed in the shape of an A) and the hallways give the effect of a catwalk. The only somewhat negative remark was that the front desk staff also acted as a concierge. They were all very efficient, pleasant and knowledgable but we found them somewhat cold and they did not try to connect with the guest like other 5 star hotels we have stayed in"

471033682,March 2017,5.0,Beste Lage f√ºr Shopping,Das Hotel kann ich nur jedem weiter empfehlen. Super freundliches Peronal und sehr hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer sind hochmodern alles wir per iPad gesteuert. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck l√§sst keine W√ºnsche offen und ist wundersch√∂n angerichtet.Das einzige was wir wirklich ankreiden m√ºssen ist der vom Hotel organisierte Shuttle. Wie sich im Nachhinein zeigte war der 3x so teuer wie ein normales Taxi. Da kommt man sich ein wenig verarscht vor denn das entspricht ganz und gar nicht den sonst so hervorragenden Empfehlungen vom Hotel.
468553757,February 2017,2.0,Improvements could be made,"Room type:Deluxe doubleRoom: Sophisticated decorations, high-tech room control system. Bathroom was spacious and eye-catching. What we didn‚Äôt expect was, a disconnected wi-fi which took a couple of hours to fix (the first call from the reception telling us it was fixed was false, and we had to call them to look into it again), our room keycards deactivated one day prior to checkout, and the emergency light above our bed (which couldn‚Äôt be switched off unless the blackout is resolved) waking us up in the middle of the night when the hotel had a blackout. I sincerely believe these were honest mistakes and unfortunate coincidences, but improvements could be made.Staff:The majority of the staff were polite and well trained. We asked our concierge for recommendations and reservations for restaurants serving specific Milanese cuisine, and our needs were always met."
466830513,January 2017,4.0,Buen hotel en Milan,"Es mi segunda experiencia en este hotel y si bien no decepciona sigue teniendo muchas cosas por mejorar. El hotel es super moderno y de muy agradable decoracion aunque se nota cierta falta de mantenimiento por todas partes.La primera habitaci√≥n que nos ofrecieron era interna, sin luz, muy peque√±a e incomoda. Luego nos ofrecieron otra habitaci√≥n con vista a la calle que era un poco mejor, sin embargo el mobiliario necesita una urgente renovaci√≥n ya que el desgaste del mismo es bastante notorio e inaceptable para un hotel de esta categor√≠a.La distribuci√≥n de la habitaci√≥n no me parece muy buena ya que tiene un vest√≠bulo  grande que no se utiliza, as√≠ como un ba√±o muy grande tambi√©n, mientras que el sector de la cama y escritorio es peque√±o.Es destacable que los art√≠culos del minibar sean sin cargo (lo cual me parece genial) y los articulos de tocado armani que se ofrecen tambi√©n son excelentes.Tambi√©n hay una cafetera nespresso en la habitaci√≥n con c√°psulas sin cargo.La atenci√≥n del personal es correcta pero para nada extraordinaria. A pesar de que llov√≠a bastante, cada vez que solicitabamos un paraguas en la entrada del hotel nos hac√≠an todo tipo de preguntas lo cual resultaba bastante molesto.El spa es uno de los mejores servicios que ofrece el hotel (piscina de relax + saunas sin cargo adicional). La atenci√≥n del spa era muy buena, salvo que no nos permitieron ingresar con vestidos y cambiarnos en el vestuario, sino que te obligan a bajar en bata desde la habitaci√≥n (lo cual no es de mi agrado), cosa que antes era diferente.Por ultimo, la ubicaci√≥n del hotel es excelente ya que se encuentra cerca de las principales atracciones de la ciudad.En resumen, es un hotel de lujo, moderno que desmejor√≥ un poco con los a√±os pero resulta una interesante opci√≥n para aquellos viajeros que no esperan un nivel de servicio sobresaliente."

439579780,August 2016,4.0,love the smell... :),"The Armani hotel has a great location - it's definitely a great place for business trips, it's easily accessible, but it is not quite Mandarin Oriental or Four Seasons standard. Again, these are a little more expensive.The design is great - but the furnishing is slightly worn, which doesn't feel quite right in a very glossy/dark environment. Plus it's not ideal for people that sleep with the window open and want quiet (location).What I always loved there was the smell (amazing!!), shampoos and creams (Armani Prive - amazing!!) and breakfasts. Plus the fact that the Nobu restaurant is in the building. That's definitely a must-go-to spot!"
439417219,November 2016,5.0,Milan 2016,One of the best hotel in Milan. Nice rooms. Professional  and friendly staff. Excellent hotel location-center of the city. Beautiful bar and restaurant with warm atmosphere. With out any doubts will come back here again.

432143339,October 2016,4.0,Design is everything?,"Armani hotel is well known institution of Milan and when you make a reservation there you expect nothing less than perfection in every segment of your stay. I can't say that hotel isn't impressive, but perfect design isn't all I expect from my accommodation. It isn't even my primary goal when choosing a hotel. And in Armani hotel everything is about design which is not always the most comfortable, most practical or most convenient for their guests. Maybe I am too picky, but I have been in lots of 5 stars hotels all over the world and I'm hard to impress purely by the brand of the hotel. Therefore I will use this opportunity to point out things that I did and didn't like at Armani hotel.Location is great, in the center of the town and close to everything. The entrance is a little bit cold and empty and some people find it complicated to have one elevator taking them to the Lobby and then the other from the Lobby to the room, but this way you are totally separated from the street and I don't see any problem in that concept.We had a room at the 5th floor with no view, but to the yard. The size of the room is not very big, but the bathroom is large and nicely designed with spacious shower and bathtub. Everything in the room is controlled by the iPad, so with it you open or close your curtains, control TV or music, lights and order additional services such as Room service, Laundry...etc. But this iPad is not always such a great solution, because when you order something with it, it seems that it doesn't always work. I have ordered some extra pillows twice, but nothing happened before I actually called the reception and they've said that this orders thru iPad don't always work. This iPad also very easily get run out of battery if you don't return it on the charger and then operating anything in the rooms becomes the problem. I have seen similar solutions in other hotels that were much better done. The main problem in my room was a lack of a closet space.  Hidden behind the doors and above the drawers with cups and glasses in it, is a small wardrobe but only for short things such as shirts and skirts and with no place where you can hang your dress or coat. If you still have a coat and do not want to throw it on the floor you can get a portable hanger that will additionally overcrowd your already not so big room.  And, at the end, ruin the impeccable design of it.The rest of the hotel is nice in typical Armani design. SPA is great, clean and well maintained with large Jacuzzi overlooking Milan. Breakfast is not included and pricy (40Euros), but there is plenty things on the buffet to choose from and cooked dishes are done just the way they should be. The Bamboo bar is very busy since it is quite popular with non-hotel guests too.But if you are a true Armani fan, at the ground floor of the hotel you can find a large shops with Armani close and accessories, Armani chocolates, Armani flowers‚Ä¶ That way you are sure that you will take a nice Armani memory home or bring a greatly appreciated gift to your loved ones."

429783969,September 2016,5.0,Last minute change of rooms because of lack of space.,We had a suite at Bulgar hotel but in the end we found out that that suite would not be big enough for what our plans were. So we did a little research and found a marvelous suite at the Armani hotel just around the corner. The suite was impeccable and the service superb. Great SPA with fantastic masseurs and gym.
428911152,September 2016,5.0,The perfect hotel in the heart of Milan,We stayed for 3 nights. It is walking distance to the Duomo and all the shopping areas. The service was unbelievable .

Definitely look forward to going back !

Minimalism is dominated in the interior of the property (a little bit complicated entrance and lobby for the first view but nothing to complain). Perfectly located for business, shopping and leisure. One of the most friendly staff I've ever meet. Especially lovely Valentina always ready to assist. We've been lucky for free late check out possibility since our flight was late in the afternoon. Nice breakfast have to admit. Would definitely recommend this hotel."

421063289,September 2016,5.0,Over the top!,"I can't say enough about this hotel!  We have stayed all over the world in several 5 star hotels. This modern, chic hotel will now be one of the top. From the customer service to the room features (fully automated from an in room iPad) and Armani everything else (furniture, rugs, linens), there is no reason to stay anywhere else. If you're coming to Milan to shop, the best stores are right out the front door!"
419892812,September 2016,5.0,Elegant. Sophisticated.,"My first hotel review and I travel 100 days a year. Love this hotel. Like Armani himself it is elegant, sophisticated, romantic. Clean lines. Very contemporary but warm. Don't stay if you want flowing drapes  and clutter. No doorknobs. Everything controlled by iPad on your bedside table. Even room service though you can talk to a human if you prefer. I would come back to Milan just to stay in the hotel. not for those on budget but worth it."
419285596,September 2016,5.0,Forget about any other hotel in Milano!,This was far one of my best stays in hotels around the world. Very friendly and helpful staff (Specially Emilio and the two other nice ladies)The hotel got everything you need in style. From food to Spa. Location is perfect. Didn't find any mistake except one (little noise could be heard from next room) if occupied.

417933608,August 2016,5.0,ROOM 232: 04 AUGT 2016: 1 NIGHT SHORT STAY IN THE ARMANI HOTEL MILANO,"This hotel report will be very brief as I only stayed one night.  We checked in the hotel in the late afternoon around 5PM and we checked out the next day around 09AM as we needed to leave early for meetings the whole day. CHECK IN: fast and efficientCHECK OUT: fast and efficientBREAK FAST: buffet area, not too elaborate, rather small, basic.  The pastries are good. Coffee is great BAR: we went for a late night cap before going to bed, drinks are good.  ROOM: very very nice.  I was impressed.  Here and there you can tell that the room needs a bit of a freshen up, some wear and tear.  The amenities are great!  Bottles of Shampoo and shower gel!  Very generous.  I took a bath to relax before getting ready for dinner with our guests.   PRICE: fairly high, this is of course the down side but....there is only 1 ARMANI HOTEL in Milan.  STAFF: service is excellent and genuineLOCATION: very good, very walkable, close the the boutiques and not too far from LINATE airport.DOWNSIDE: they should have aired our room, it smells a bit stuffy, no fresh air.  Will I come back?  Yes."

417199625,September 2016,4.0,Nice hotel,"This is a nice modern hotel within a convenient location. The Nobu restaurant downstairs is worth trying. In room dining is good but probably don't order their coffee.    This is my second visit to this hotel, the room quality is still good, but the service quality of the reception staff needs some improve. Not feeling welcomed by this visit.    High light of this hotel is the free minibar."
416196596,September 2016,5.0,Sleek Perfection,"The Armani Hotel has service down to an art form.  I can't think of anything about our stay that was not perfect.  The rooms are so beautiful, one almost hates to muss them. The bathrooms are roomy. The bathrobes are luscious as are the towels.  There is a fully-stocked fridge with drinks and  Nespresso machine in each room, making returning to the room for a late afternoon nap a pleasure. The staff is wonderful, quiet and composed. The woman are all beautiful, or perhaps it's just that they all look so good in their Armani suits and dresses. The location of the Armani is a real advantage. You can walk to everything you came to see and more. The elevator sustem took some getting used to, with the lobby above the rooms.  The gym was a  nice plus with good air conditioning, beautiful views, good equipment and chilled water bottles, unusual in Italian hotels."
413873282,August 2016,5.0,Armani excellence,"Perfection in every department - beautiful rooms, a junior suite is recommended or if a double try for one of the higher floors with a balcony.High tech i pad controller is the only negative. The hotel staff are exceptional, which is no surprise.  Great location at the heart of the best top tier shopping streets.Stylish, with a Michelin starred restaurant.Two visits in one week - and we will be back if in Milan."
413707878,July 2016,5.0,Classy and Sleek,This is a first class act all the way. Located one block from the heart of one of the greatest high end shopping streets in the world.

Concierge excellent and very helpful. The breakfast excellent and plentiful. Not a negative at all with this hotel. A great experience and I would definitely stay again.

406545195,August 2016,5.0,A very cool luxury hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights at room 608 and it was a very nice experience. Hotel is at a perfect location---minute walk to Duomo yet the streets around it were very quiet. The room was nicely designed. The bathroom has the highest quality and it's very spacious. I love all the amenities they provided. Even the little coke bottle inside generous minibar--all you can drink, but we didn't consume much except for water--is cute and cool. Our 9 year old boy was very impressed. Coming from Asia where we have a lot of newly built and luxury hotels like Ritz, Shangrila-la, Four Seasons, etc., we find this hotel unique, stylish, cool and luxury in a different way. The hotel staffs were very friendly, and the service  provided were quick and efficient. If we come back to Milan again, we will stay here! Many thanks again to all Armani staffs in this hotel!"

The location is just perfect right in the middle of the shopping district.Staff are trained to treat you like you are the only guests in the hotel.Rooms are very classy with the Armani touch everywhere.Amenities are ones you actually hate leaving behind.. I hated leaving the shampoo, conditioner and the gel.. :(Service is out of this world.We loved Milan, and everything it had to offer and would like to visit it again and have to stay at Armani to get the same unique personal experience."

The area is probably the best in Milan. Walking district to ""Beverly Hills"".Everyone from the security by the door, the front desk, restaurant staff have been excellent. Especially, Mario (he works the night shift) saw that my hubby had a back problem took my hubby to the dr during his time off. What can I say? It can't get better than this. Definitely we will be back to this hotel. Thank you everyone who made our trip to Milan exceptional!"

La Spa √® stupenda, il panorama unico, l'allestimento elegante e molto intimo. Peccato, ma veramente peccato che il personale non sia in grado di gestire anche in un posto cos√¨ esclusivo, la maleducazione degli ospiti.6 sole chaise longues occupate perennemente con accappatoi di chi non le utilizza - nessuno interviene in caso di conversazioni rumorose o risate sguaiate per niente consone al posto.Mi sono personalmente risentita ma non √® stato sufficiente.... Dunque SI!!! 10 e lode per tutto ma auguratevi di non condividere la vostra esperienza con persone poco adeguate al posto.Scrivo questa recensione, magari la direzione si decide ad intervenire veramente perch√® un posto cosi unico non deve lasciare un ricordo negativo.Lo staff dei massaggiatori √® impeccabile, disponibile, competente e attento.Personalmente sono stata trattata da Tea e Sarah, grandi professioniste. Trovo lo spogliatoio un po' buio e troppo ridotto negli spazi. Ma super accessoriato di prodotti bagno e asciugamani, ciabattine, spazzole mono uso, phon ecc....Incrociate le dita e sperate nell'educazione del prossimo.... Oggi qualit√† rara ovunque."
395857289,July 2016,4.0,Posizione strategica!!!,"Ho soggiornato presso l' Armani Hotel a Milano a Luglio per lavoro.Le camere sono belle e spaziose, ma l' aspetto pi√π importante √®' che sono estremamente silenziose. Ho avuto occasione di utilizzare la Spa posta all' ultimo piano dell' immobile e l' ho trovata fantastica!!!! Il Bar e' molto frequentato e con uno staff eccellente. La posizione strategica di quest'albergo mi ha molto agevolata durante gli spostamenti. Suggerisco vivamente la loro prima colazione servita nel ristorante con vista su tutta Milano ! Sar√† una delizia sia per il palato che per gli occhi!!!"
395378681,July 2016,5.0,Unbelievable Restaurant,"Absolutely amazing restaurant - great views, service impeccable, food as good as it gets and an overall wonderful experience. Would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Milan. I didn't stay in the hotel (unfortunately!)"

En ce qui concerne purement l'√©valuation h√¥teli√®re, cet h√¥tel est certes magnifique mais pour ma part trop froid et manque cruellement d'une √¢me. Rien a redire sur la quantit√© de l'h√©bergement c'est digne des meilleurs hotels de cette cat√©gorie tout comme son prix √©lev√© pour Milan."
391847515,July 2016,5.0,Brilliant,"I booked this as a surprise for my husband. He was not disappointed and neither was I.Ideal location, clean. Professional staff. The spa was great- not many loungers available. The whole experience here was luxurious. I would stay here again and would recommend it to all."
391272894,July 2016,5.0,Sophisticated Control System  & Very Clean Rooms,"I am writing this from the hotel room. Overall an excellent stay - (1) excellent location ; (2) very clean rooms - even the window grills are clean; (3) smooth control system with iPad as the remote control; (4) helpful and knowledgable staff; and (5) great spa. However, there were a couple of glitches - (1) delivery was not always right. In fact it was very wrong. We asked for a plate and knife but got an ice bucket and a spoon!!! and (2) there was no face cleanser and we had to ask for toothpaste and toothbrushes. Perhaps we are spoiled from staying in Asian hotels where there is usually a vast collection of toiletries. Notstanding, I would highly recommend this hotel to singles, couples and solo travellers."
390502619,July 2016,5.0,Modern Hotel with great staff and spa,"We spent two nights at the Armani hotel and from the moment you check in you know that you are staying at a hotel where staff is highly trained to service your every need.   The rooms were very modern and comfortable. Dining there was excellent however expensive, of course you are visiting a truly exceptional hotel Treat yourself and spend a few night there!"

381111654,May 2016,5.0,THE BEST HOTEL EVER,"Armani Hotel Milano staff were exemplary in assisting me with my late-night arrival after bad weather delayed my arrival, causing me to miss my connecting flight. With unfailing courtesy and unwavering support, they helped a frazzled, jet-lagged traveler returning to Europe from the States find rest in surroundings that I can only describe as heavenly, something out of a dream. The location, of course, is ideal for anyone who enjoys Milan and walking, instead of always being driven or using public transport. My experience eating lunch at the hotel's Bamboo Bar was also sublime. I particularly recommend the Ca' de Bosso Spumanti, their top of the wine list sparkling wine (at 25 euros per glass, worth every penny, because it was genuinely one of the finest wines I have ever indulged in). With the view, ambiance, proximity to the fashion world (whether you wish to purchase or merely enjoy window-shopping) the Armani Milano is a destination hotel that should be on everyone's list for a must-experience. Next time, I am visiting specifically for the spa, as well as the luxuriously appointed and exceptionally comfortable accommodations. Giorgio Armani truly is a genius, and deserves all kinds of kudos for this delightful hotel."
378669230,May 2016,5.0,Fantastic Food and Great Service,"We recently visited the Armani hotel restaurant for a group meal, and the service we received was exceptional. The food was fantastic worthy of the michelin star. This was a wonderful experience and would definitely do again."

374118121,May 2016,5.0,The small details,"Stayed four days on the 4th floor with a balcony. Wonderful wonderful wonderful. The decor is typical Armani and well thought out. All the small details are there: bathroom toiletries - everything possible is available; kitchen - Nespresso machine and 3 different types of capsules, with a kettle and assorted teas, sweet and savory snacks, water and juices all available and part of the room price; iPad controls everything, even the TV, with a nice selection of DVD/movies. (Can be a bit fiddly though if you just want to quickly turn down the volume.)Front desk, housekeeping, restaurant staff and doormen all so friendly and helpful. Quick to do all any bidding. Location is fantastic, whether you're shopping for designer brands or high street brands. Worth every penny."
374006187,February 2016,5.0,Unbeatable,"This was one of the best European holiday break ever, let me explain you why.The position of the Hotel is Unbeatable, hundreds meters away from both Duomo and Fashion district.

373580139,April 2016,5.0,Amazing Hotel,The hotel is right at the fashion district of Milan and very close the main attractions of the city. The only downside is the fact that most of restaurants in the city close on sundays so it's very important to plan ahead.

Die M√∂bel sind schlicht und die Zimmer sind sehr minimalistish eingerichtet, keine auff√§llige Deko oder sonst iergendwas wie man es in italienischen Hotels gerne sieht. Alles sehr steril, was nicht wirklich ein gem√ºtliches Ambiente hervorruft. Der Hausduft ist so stark, dass man schon fast Kopfweh kriegt. In dem kleinen Raucherabteil in der Bamboo Bar √ºberquillten die Aschenbecher, da man sie nicht geleert hat. Personal ist eher arrogant als charmant und f√ºr ein Zimmer, was ‚Ç¨1000 kostet noch ‚Ç¨40 f√ºr s Fr√ºhst√ºck separat zu kassieren finde ich schon fast frech. Wir kamen von Z√ºrich direkt √ºber Andermatt, wo wir im The Chedi wohnten. Ein krasser Vergleich allein was die Seehle des Hauses betrifft. N√§chstes Mal werde ich in Milano bestimmt nicht mehr ins Armani gehen. Habe das Mandarin Oriental angeschaut, welches mir  vom Ambiente im Haus mehr zusagt."

363066740,April 2016,3.0,High tech and Minimalism counterproductive,"Armani esthetics and style are appealing but a hotel's purpose is to make the client comfortable and sadly I was not. The high tech guide-everything with your IPad is sexy but in practise it is clumsy and unnecessarily complicated for someone staying a night or two and with other purposes for staying in Milan than figuring out the system. The touch screen does not always respond. Manipulating a heavy tablet is NOT nicer than pressing a button by your bed. That option does exist but is lit up with the white light which is known to disrupt sleep and just at eye level when lying in bed...The bathroom, as so often is the case is large and pretty but impractical.Very little place to put down your own toiletries. The WC compartment is huge but the actual WC and paper holder are crammed into a tiny corner where even the toilet paper is hard to get to. As in many trendy hotels, there is a ""rain shower"" where one can't avoid wetting one's hair. In our case it could not be turned off to use the hand shower. Very annoying for ladies especially. The complimentary slippers for ladies were in such a small size, I could not use them - this happens in many other hotels as well. As in many minimalist hotels, they very quickly show wear and tear as in scuffed walls and knocks or scratches here and there despite impecable cleaning. Minimalism is not easy.On the positive side, The bed was comfortable and the service was extremely friendly. The Wifi worked well and the complimentary mini bar was welcoming. The hotel is well located. The breakfast was nice but a bit excessive in price considering the room price."

361603231,February 2016,5.0,Elegance in style,"We moved form Rome to Milan and have to say what a difference, even in Hotels quality and standards. This Armani Hotel has its own charme on his own. Everything you touch is Armani branded from interiors to room products all Armani Casa. We love the scent you smell in the Lobby as soon as you enter and also in the rooms. Service is overall good , think has to do with the local culture, everyone is friendly, accommodating and smiley. Ww tried the food in the Restaurant and was divine , we surprisely got to know they have a Michelin Star, great experience there. Mr. Armani managed to also have a great quality in the restaura too, all in all a great stay , would recommend a balcony room with a Dome view on 6th floor"
361367226,February 2016,5.0,Armanissimo,"I had the great pleasure to visit the amazing Armani Milano last month for a business dinner at the Italian restaurant of the hotel. Perfectly located, the hotel has been entirely designed by Giorgio Armani himself, to the smallest detail. The result is a very impressive and √ºber chic architecture and setup, beautiful in every way. My first impression upon arrival was to enter a modern cathedral, a temple of Italian good taste and excellence. The dinner was superb, with a creative, fresh and very tasteful cuisine prepared by the Michelin starred Master Chef. Excellent service and great selection of Italian wines. We had the honor of meeting the general manager Mr Aru during our evening at the hotel, a high profile professional who has worked in different parts of the World, very welcoming and professional. If you happen to be in Milan, don't miss the experience."
360993190,March 2016,5.0,Going up the down elevator!,"To be frank, this hotel and it's unique character takes some getting used to.  First and most important, don't lose sight of the fact that from the minute you step into the hotel, you are Mr. Armani's guest!  There is no lobby as we all think of hotel lobbies.  Instead, you take the elevator up to the 7th floor where the reception, bar and restaurant are all located.  After checking in, which is one most of the most pleasurable I have ever had in a hotel, you take the elevator down where you are shown to your room.  The room is completely automated from the lighting, aircon, tv, etc.  Oh, did I mention that everything and I mean everything is included in with the room rate from the mini-bar to the Nespresso maker and pods, water - sparking or still, newspaper, breakfast.  Need a transformer? printer? No problem!  Instead having to wait who knows long, they appear like magic.  Breakfast in your room is also no longer than a 15 minute wait!  A modern miracle in today's world.  And wonders upon wonders, it actually arrives hot!  Are you looking for a down side, it's the bar.  We ordered a double GG that looked liked it was poured from an eye dropper and, no FOX news!  All in all, kudos to Mr Armani and his staff of extremely and very dedicated personnel to making this hotel a true gem in the world of so called 5 stars hotels.  We would we go back?  In a New York Minute!"
360348281,March 2016,5.0,Travelled with wife and baby daughter,"Bathrooms are huge, and in general rooms are good value for Milan. Free soft drinks in minibar.

358367384,March 2016,5.0,A mystifying experience of sophisticated living!,"The amalgamation of modernity, luxury and eminent Armani finesse make it one of the best hotels we've ever had the privilege to stay at. From the moment we entered to the moment we exited,the engaging and highly professional staff made our every wish and request come true in nanoseconds, and the efficiency of the room services (IPad control system) was such a pleasant surprise,even for my non tech savvy mother,who was mesmerized and completely taken in by the exploration, the exquisite meal at the restaurant and of course the spa pampering and view."
357928676,March 2016,5.0,Can't recommend it enough,"I was between staying at the Park Hyatt and the Armani hotel, and I decided to stay at Armani. Park Hyatt is closer to the Duomo, and I was worried that I might not like Armani's location.Boy was I wrong. I arrived on Sunday late afternoon. I was promptly checked in and upgraded for free. The 'lifestyle manager' showed me to my room and explained the room amenities. You have an iPad by your bed which controls everything in the room, and can even order room service for you or request an adapter. The minibar was complementary. The room and bathroom were both spacious, and I loved the products provided in the bathroom. The hotel is in the designer district, so all the top labels are at your door. It is also a 10 minute walk from the duomo. When I went to the duomo it was crazy packed with tourists. I was so happy that I decided to stay at Armani because it's close enough to walk to the duomo but far enough to escape the crowds.I had breakfast at Armani on one day and they have a great selection: buffet, Italian breakfast (pastries, juice and coffee), American breakfast (pastries, eggs, coffee and juice), or a la carte (everything from pancakes to eggs benedict). I even got a manicure at the spa and everyone who worked there was friendly and professional. Loved my nails!  Perfect hotel. Would definitely stay here next time."

The rooms are a joy, (if you don't mind controlling everything from an iPad) A very original entrance to the rooms a pons into a minimalist space that at the same time has everything. The bathroom is great, with a huge bathtub and separate shower. Big big mirrors. The bar is fun and the restaurant also very modern with some nice views of the city. Small but very nice Gym with great views and the spa area. Also you have a huge two level Armani store, maybe the biggest in the world. Service is great, impecable. Walking distance to the ""Duomo"" and the main shopping streets."

346778938,February 2016,5.0,Great Service,Bathroom is considered big in Milan. Nice Gym.  Location is very convenient.  Staff is very knowledgeable and well trained.  Concierge is very helpful.  We do feel safe staying at the Armani Hotel whereas my husband's backpack was stolen in a hotel during breakfast 20 years ago.  We also heard terrible stories about handbags being stolen in the Four Seasons Hotel.  There are a lot of fake police showing fake Police ID and ask to search your bags.  Watch out and be careful.

342621641,January 2016,5.0,I didn't want to leave,"A wonderful experience; throughout the hotel the attention to detail of Mr Armani is apparent and all the better for it. The staff were pleasant, discreet and respectful. I found them very helpful regarding restaurant and sightseeing recommendations. The room was lovely. Beautiful Armani Casa furnishings which were carefully matched with bedding, curtains and blinds to create the inimitable Armani look which relies on subtle, tonal interplays.The bathroom was superb. The best I have ever experienced; separate rain shower, double sinks, bath, private area, underfloor heating and lots of room. Thoughtful lighting throughout. Armani shower gel scented with armani Prive Bois d'encens....mmmmm.And the location; near Via Montenapoleone for shopping and 5 minutes walk to the Duomo/ La Scala etc.We ate at Armani/Nobu and the food was excellent.If I won the lottery I would love to take all my friends for a long weekend to the Armani Hotel. A great place to base yourself in a historic and cultured city."

The SPA is definitely one of the best spa experience I had ever!!  Juste amaizing! (Breakfast and bar is not the best part. So not a must to do) If you go to Milano for the fashion part of the city and you love luxery hotels than is hotel Armani the place to be!   I can't wait to come back"
318387255,October 2015,5.0,Amazing,"From the moment we walked in, to the day we left the service was impeccable. We arrived early. They tried there best to accommodate us. We got in  so early that they were still serving breakfast. The attention to detail is phenomenal, and the food delicious. We left and discovered the city a bit.   When we came back the room still wasn't ready yet.  They asked us to sit in the bar while we waited and they would get us a nice coffee. They truly couldn't of done enough for us .The hotel is centrally located in the heart and pulse of Milan. If you like to walk everywhere, this is your hotel. It is sleek, very modern, so cool.Mr. Armani takes great pleasure and pride in this hotel. It shows through every detail down to the amenities in the room. While pricey, and chic, they truly have the most down-to-earth staff ever. Should my travels take me back to Milan again in the future, I would not stay anywhere else."

316860120,October 2015,5.0,"""Just like home"".........Dan Menchions and Keith rushbrook","From the minute we stepped though the doors of the hotel,  we knew we were going to have a wonderful stay.  From the doormen to the concierge to the reception to the bell hop to the staff at every level.  Our stay and experience at the hotel was beyond excellent.  Unfortunately I arrived with a terrible cold and spent the first 3 days in the hotel.  The hotel really felt like home.  It was extremely comfortable and we made the best of it and loved every minute of are stay.  Our suite was spectacular and every detail was beautifully executed.  The entire room was automated.  The ipads were easy to navigate.  The restaurant,  bar and lounge on the 7th floor were absolutely stunning and the staff and service were absolutely wonderful and delightful.   The food in the restaurant and lounge was absolutely delicious.  And the room service menu and staff were fantastic.  You could also order off menu and have whatever you wanted.  We spent 5 full nights and 6 full days at the hotel and i could have stayed longer.  We only ventured away form the hotel for a dinner down the street.  Which was delicious,  but we remained true to the hotel and really took advantage of everything they had to offer.  They even set me up with stunning pj's because I had forgot to pack mine before we left.  Again, every detail not missed.    There are too many staff to name, but they were all just incredible at every level.I can't rave much more on how great our experience was.  We will definitely make it our second home when returning to Milan."

316482162,September 2015,5.0,unparalleled design and quality,We had the pleasure to stay at some of the best hotels in Europe during our 3 weeks visit and Armani Milan was undoubtedly the best overall.

Armani has set a new standard for the rest of the industry to aspire to.
315751017,September 2015,5.0,Typical Armani,"Being a fan of Giorgio Armani products, and having stayed at the Armani Hotel in Dubai, this was an obvious choice when travelling to Milano. My wife & I stayed here in Sep 2015 for 2 nights, and it was a relaxing and very nice experience. Excellent interior design as would be expected, and the location in the fashion area is brilliant, with a short walk to the Duomo. We were given a free room upgrade which was pleasantly surprising, and have to say the staff were all exceptionally nice, much better than expected. The only fault was the plumbing, with the shower having an issue running constantly warm (hot then cold then hot), but this was really only a minor inconvenience to an otherwise amazing stay..."
310499685,August 2015,5.0,Impressive Service! Bravo!,"Stayed here for two nights and had a great time. The hotel is hard to fault. The design is magnificent and the staff is very competent and friendly. They truly give you Italian hospitality at its finest. Every staff member was extremely polite and knowledgeable.Location is very convenient near all the high end boutiques and close to the Duomo and metro stop. The room is very luxuriously appointed as can be expected. Everything is well thought out and can be adjusted using the iPad in the room. The bed is very comfortable, bathroom is huge and the small touches like complimentary mini bar and Nespeesso coffee gives it a true 5 star touch. The spa area is very well designed and truly impressive. We had breakfast once in the hotel but whilst it is not cheap it offers high quality and a decent choice (incl. Prosecco). I truly enjoyed my stay there and can recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious stay in Milan."

302762880,August 2015,5.0,A wonderful escape,"We've just visited the Armani Spa on top of the hotel. We haven't slept in the hotel so my comment it's just about the Spa, but I think most of the considerations could be applied to the whole.Everything here is inspired by the ""less is more"" motto that Mr Armani applied to all his creations. Nothing it's out of place and all personnel is embarrassingly kind, helpful and friendly (I do not agree with someone who talked about false kindness).The Spa is fairly small, but this increases the sense of exclusivity and let you feel pampered and special during every minute of your stay. The drawback is that you can' expect all the features of a fully fledged spa, but you can have a steam bath, a Finnish sauna and a large and comfortable jacuzzi wtih a mesmerizing view over the skyline (You can see the duomo, the skyscrapers district, churches and amazing penthouses). The cabin had wonderful views as well. We have been hosted in the VIP room with two beds so we had a view on Duomo and we have been told that if you select the VIP program you can sit in a private room for 30 minutes with two chaise longue facing the Duomo.The massages where very well executed and on par to the one you can experience in ""specialized"" hotels.After the treatment, comfortably laid over a gorgeous chaise longue, you are served with an extraction of your choice.About prices they are aligned to top spas in Europe, but given the location, the pricey city and the quality of service they are absolutely fair (Extractions and access to the Spa are included in the treatment cost).All in all it has been a wonderful escape and we'll return for sure in winter to enjoy the warm of the spa and, getting dark early, the view over a glittering Milan skyline."

Once i entered my room, I was surprised with a bowl of fresh strawberries. During my stay I had breakfast at 7th floor, at the Armani Restaurant, breakfast selection is awesome and you could also enjoy your breakfast quietly in the upper part of the restaurant. One night I decided to eat in my room, it was a little bit late, but, the food selection for the night menu is very good and well selected.The order was in my room in no more than 15 minutes.

279270512,June 2015,2.0,Armani's not ready for the Hotel business !,"Poor service, no attention, dirty walls in the room, impersonal and virtually no Concierge. We did not had a good experience for what was outrageously expensive. So unless you are from Middle East, design fanatic, or an obvious 'People' do not expect any attention.Staff looks more after themselves than clients, and the place is designed to make you uncomfortable. Technology is everywhere, but does not work up to what you could expect. I liked the high ceilings and the design of the room though.The restaurant was not lively, but good and with a very nice view. We enjoyed that part. For the rest, one of my worst hotel experience at a very high price."

259899530,July 2014,5.0,"Eclecticism, Luxury, Elegance.","In the heart of Milan‚Äôs fashion district, known as Quadrilatero della Moda, Armani Hotel opened its doors on November 2011. The impressive Palazzo at Via Manzoni 31 was vertically extended through a glass structure that is shaped into an ‚ÄòA‚Äô, as one can see on the architectural ground plan or from a helicopter view, and  manages to combine harmoniously a historic building‚Äôs facade with ultra modern interiors. Located just a few steps from Via Montenapoleone and Via della Spiga and within walking distance from the Duomo.PGM and I stayed there for 3 days to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary on July 2014. As we had planned a road trip around lake Como for a few days before our stay in Milan, we decided to leave one piece of luggage at the hotel and pick up our car from there. The front door staff, or as he introduced himself ‚Äòour Lifestyle Manager‚Äô was very helpful, stored our luggage and guided us to the 7th floor lounge, where the reception and the Bamboo Bar are situated, in order to enjoy a coffee before leaving for Como. This first impression of the hotel was excellent, making us very eager to return from our road trip and enjoy our stay in Milan.When we finally returned, after exploring the picturesque lakes of northern Italy, we were pleasantly surprised by our room. Let me point out that the hotel may look a bit cold in the photos, but in reality the calm colors and rich materials give you a feeling of serenity and luxury. Every room has a vestibule entrance, an intervening space before entering the main bedroom area, which is elegantly furnished by Armani Casa. The extra long kingsize bed is very comfortable with fluffy pillows and the moment we arrived a heart made of rose petals was waiting for us on it, along with Armani trademark chocolates and wishes for our anniversary. Everything elegant and simple enough, in total harmony with the hotel‚Äôs philosophy. There is also a complimentary mini-bar and a Nespresso coffee machine. The stone and marble bathroom is ample-sized, equipped with a shower and a bathtub and bathed in light entering from a big window over the bathtub. Attention is payed to every small detail, from the length of towels and the softness of bathrobes to the high quality toiletries with the distinctive Armani scent that is evident from the moment you enter the hotel‚Äôs ‚ÄòA‚Äô marked entrance. Rumor has it that Armani himself has approved everything. Even the minimal hotel logo, the Duomo in gold, that is revealed at the bottom of each coffee cup, even the ‚ÄòA‚Äô marked sugar cubes, all these simple touches add up to create a unique lifestyle experience. last but not least, you can control almost everything by a remote device. Every room is equipped with Bose speakers, but as those still have a 30 pin connector for older iDevices, remember to bring your own 30pin-to-lightning converter as we always do.The Bamboo Bar on the 7th floor, with floor-to-ceiling high glass windows, gives panoramic views of Milan‚Äôs rooftops and lets the daylight in, softened by the louver blades. In this bright area, you can enjoy your morning coffee, breakfast, lunch and as the night falls and the atmosphere becomes more vibrant, you can enjoy an italian aperitivo. We liked everything especially the cocktails that were accompanied with tasty small bites and the great quality coffee. The Armani Ristorante is next to the Bamboo Bar and shares the same double volume ceiling and equal, if not better, views. Unfortunately we did not have time to try the menu there, which is based on traditional italian cuisine. The Palazzo at Via Manzoni is also the house of Nobu Milan, Armani Priv√© and Emporio Armani Caffe, though they are not part of the hotel.The Armani Spa, covering an area of 1000 square meters on the 8th floor, is the absolute place for mind and body relaxation and pampering. The indoor pool has glass ceiling and at the time we visited the spa it was raining, creating a very serene atmosphere. There is also an area with comfortable lounge chairs just in front of the large windows. A fitness club with the same view from the treadmills is on the same floor, as are the spa treatment rooms.The staff is polite and efficient, but sometimes, in an effort to be discreet, the service feels impersonal and the reception understaffed. The Concierge helped us book every restaurant we wanted, but we interacted with the Lifestyle manager only upon arrival, when he helped us with our suitcases and later accompanied us to our room. Maybe if we stayed more, we would be able to have a more complete opinion about the made-to-measure experience that they are supposed to provide.As it is advertised by the hotel, the ‚ÄòStay with Armani‚Äô philosophy promises and delivers a ‚Äòhome-away-from-home‚Äô experience, a shelter from the buzzing streets of Milan center, a haven of privacy, luxury and elegance. We will definitely be back."
257257419,February 2015,5.0,Perfect,"Sounds pretentious but Armani hotel in milan is the best if you are into minimalist high- tech traveler like I am.the hotel is huge, spacious and beautiful with a city over looking view which makes all the difference.The spa is perfect, clean and with a view.Loved it."
256495496,February 2015,4.0,Excelente Hotel en Milan,"En primer lugar hay que destacar la ubicaci√≥n del hotel ya que la misma resulta inmejorable.En segundo lugar hay que destacar la decoraci√≥n general del hotel (lujo moderno) y la amabilidad de su personal que en general era excelente.En tercer lugar no puedo dejar de destacar la buena predisposici√≥n del se√±or que nos efectu√≥ el check in (cuyo nombre no recuerdo en este momento) ya que al manifestarle que dese√°bamos una habitaci√≥n externa hizo lo posible para conseguirla (la tuvimos para 3 de las 4 noches de nuestra estad√≠a). En cuanto al hotel en general, como mencione anteriormente, tiene una ambientaci√≥n muy moderna y en mi opinion de un muy buen gusto. Es lujoso pero no desde el punto de vista del lujo tradicional sino que es sumamente moderno y actual (a aquellos que prefieran la decoraci√≥n clasica quiz√°s no les guste demasiado).El trato del personal es bueno en general pero sin ser excelente (en el sentido de excelencia que en mi opinion muy pocos hoteles detentan) . Mas all√° de esta salvedad no tuvimos ning√∫n inconveniente y el trato fue muy bueno.EL lobby del hotel se encuentra situado en el septimo piso por lo que como en todos los hoteles que esto ocurre, es necesario tomar dos ascensores para llegar a la habitaci√≥n (uno hasta el lobby y luego otro para ""bajar"" hasta el piso de la habitaci√≥n). Esto puede resultar un tanto tedioso pero debo mencionar que es cada vez mas habitual (de hecho por citar algunos recuerdo que tienen este sistema hoteles como el Conrad de Tokyo, Mandarin Oriental de la Vegas, W de Santiago, etc)El restaurante sera criticado en un post aparte.La habitaci√≥n que tuvimos la primer noche (de las 4 en total) fue la 208 y si bien no tenia vista a la calle era realmente imponente. Tanto por sus dimensiones como por su mobiliario y distribuci√≥n. Era muy moderna y con todas las comodidades necesarias para pasar una magnifica estad√≠a.La habitaci√≥n en la que estuvimos hospedados las tres noches  restantes (la 404)  tenia bonitas vistas a la Via Manzoni pero no resultaba tan imponente como la anterior (quiz√°s por la forma en que estaban dispuestos los ambientes) ya que parec√≠a mas peque√±a (aunque probablemente no lo era) sobre todo el cuarto de ba√±o que era mucho mas peque√±o que la anterior habitaci√≥n. Con respecto a esta habitaci√≥n (404), a diferencia de la anterior en la que estuvimos (208), la alfombra y muebles de la misma se ve√≠an bastante gastados, de hecho considero que la alfombra que esta debajo de la cama debe ser reemplazada de manera urgente porque luce demasiado gastada.Fuera de estos aspectos, la cama me resulto bastante c√≥moda, la iluminacion muy buena y el mobiliario de excelente dise√±o (armani casa obviamente). Las habitaciones son totalmente automatizadas. Todo se maneja desde un ipad provisto en la habitaci√≥n, desde el cual se controla la iluminaci√≥n de la habitaci√≥n, del ba√±o y del vest√≠bulo. Tambi√©n desde el I pad se abren y cierran las cortinas y se controla la temperatura de la habitaci√≥n.Desde el Ipad se puede controlar los gastos del hu√©sped, chequear los menus del room service y de los restaurantes, acceder al pronostico del tiempo, y conocer otros datos del hotelAsimismo desde el I Pad se controla el TV, se puede escuchar radios y m√∫sica de todo tipo (a trav√©s de los altavoces del TV) y se puede utilizar para navegar por internet en el mismo I pad o a travez de la TV  (como smart tv).Con lo expuesto queda en claro que este hotel se caracteriza por su tecnolog√≠a ademas de su dise√±o.Asimismo en cuanto a la habitaci√≥n, es destacable el buen servicio de housekeeping y los products de aseo armani que se ofrecen. Lo unico criticable de este aspecto es que no proporcionan ningun tipo dulce o chocolate al hacer la apertura o turndown de la habitaci√≥n tal como ocurre en la mayoria de hoteles de esta categor√≠a.Por ultimo en cuanto a la habitaci√≥n hay que destacar que se ofrecen todas las bebidas sin alcohol del minibar gratuitamente as√≠ como tambi√©n los snacks y el cafe nespresso que est√°n en la habitaci√≥n.En cuanto al spa, el mismo es muy bueno, tiene hermosas vistas a la ciudad, saunas secos, h√∫medos y un gran jacuzzi que funciona perfectamente bien y con gran potencia. La se√±ora que provee las toallas es muy atenta (extremadamente atenta) y amable, siempre esta pendiente de los hu√©spedes lo cual es destacable. Por ultimo sobre el spa podr√≠amos decir que el √∫nico aspecto negativo es la escasez de sillas o camastros de relax ya que hay solo seis y casi nunca eran suficientes. Asimismo seria bueno que las recepcionistas del spa fueran mas simp√°ticas y mejor predispuestas con los hu√©spedes.En definitiva es una excelente opci√≥n y considero que ofrece una correcta relaci√≥n precio - calidad. Solo espero que renueven el mobiliario y alfombras desgastados en el corto plazo ya que seria una pena que por ese motivo decaiga la percepci√≥n que pueden tener los hu√©spedes del hotel."

248762134,December 2014,5.0,Epitome of style and comfort,"As an extended Armani brand, the hotel continues with the fundamentals of the fashion house: luxury, sophisticated and quintessential Italian. We stayed overnight to de-jetlag after a long overnight flight and it was a perfect choice. The appealing dark interiors are sleek and comfortable for us to catch up some sleep. The attention to details is phenomenal, not only visually but also ""olfactorily"". The whole hotel has a signature sense on par with the sense of its Armani toiletry, a bit mysteriously leather and cigar. This still links in my memory.Staffs are very friendly and and even playful with our four year old son. To have a toddler bed, we had to book a larger room, which was very spacious and they set up the bed speedily as we requested. Location is very ideal in the midst of all the shopping and a very short walk to the Duomo. Wish that it has a pool instead of just a giant jacuzzi as our son can't get into it for his age, but he had a lot of fun playing around the gym and spa area as it wasn't crowded. A little doubtful when we booked the hotel as we thought it may not be that ideal for us with young kids, but had a great experience instead!"
245347464,December 2014,5.0,"If ""Modern Style"" is your kind of hotel -- go for it! You will not be disappointed!","We needed a special hotel for one night on our return from Venice. It was my birthday. I booked the Armani. It was a wonderful transition from the old world style of Venice. Rooms are superb -- bedding what you would expect from this class of hotel, everything modern with all on a remote ( including window shades. The bathrooms are over the top -- spacious, heated floors, double sinks, private spaces for toilet and bidet and rainfall shower. The towels were the largest I've ever used! The amenities were beautifully crafted and wonderful to look at. The staff could not be more helpful -- we were leaving the hotel before the breakfast started and they jumped to help us pack a to go box. There was a party in the bar but we heard nothing! I will definitely come back for a longer stay!"

La Manager Monica ci accompagnava nella camera 605, grande, accogliente e confortevole con vista sul Duomo.Dopo esserci riposati abbiamo preso un aperitivo in vero stile Armani, proseguito con la cena presso il ristorante dell hotel Armani dove venivamo deliziati da due menu uno a base di  pesce e l altro a base di carne, piatti veramente ottimi. vi consiglio tartare di carne. Volevamo ringraziare tantissimo Monica che si offriva di tenerci il bambino durante la cena.

I recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to experience luxury at its best."
244425429,December 2014,5.0,classe ed eleganza,"Classe ed eleganza, √® questa la sensazione che ti rimane quando si esce dall'armani hotel. Non ero mai entrato prima di sabato all'interno di questo hotel, e mi sono subito scontrato con i soliti luoghi comuni. un albergo assolutamente aperto a tutti, (prima non osavo avvicinarmi se non al club o al nobu, il giapponese), di stile, elegante e raffinato e con una vista mozzafiato. Il personale, dal direttore all'usciere, gentilissimi e cordiali. La cosa che ho apprezzato di pi√π oltre a tutto ci√≤ sopra elencato, √® stata la vista mozzafiato che si pu√≤ ammirare sia dal ristorante, che dal bar, oltre che dalla Spa. Sia la cabina esclusiva per i massaggi che l'enorme vasca idromassaggio godono della vista duomo, con l'immancabile Madonnina ad illuminare con il suo manto dorato tutta la skyline milanese. Un luogo allo stesso tempo romantico, ideale per un regalo alla propria moglie o fidanzata. Grazie a chi me l'ha fatto scoprire."
242198495,November 2014,5.0,Attention to Details,"My husband and I just returned from our trip to Milan.   We rented a suite in this hotel. I usually stay at 5-Star hotels and have certain expectations.  The overall atmosphere is super modern. It is exactly what you would expect from a hotel owned/designed by Giorgio Armani.  The rooms are equipped with top of the line furnitures, decor, flower arrangements and equipment.   What I liked most about this hotel though, was the level of service you received.     The Armani Hotel provided little touches that went above and beyond my expectations.  For example, the mini-bar was free of charge and was being refilled twice a day.  The Hotel Bar not only served incredible cocktails with delicious olives and crackers, but they also served (free of charge) incredible appetizers which included mini sandwiches with veggies, rizzoto, steak tartare, etc.   The staff went over and above  what was expected.  For example, the first night we arrived late and exhausted, and asked that they make reservations at a local restaurant.  Since we were new to the area, we couldn't find it and therefore returned to the Hotel.  Well, one of the staff members personally walked us to the restaurant to make sure we get there.  Then since we don't speak a word of Italian, he walked in with us and made sure we were taken care of.Anything we asked for, was addressed on the spot (from i-phone chargers to adapters, to calling a Boutique to make sure our purchases would be delivered on time).This hotel did not disappoint."
242092799,October 2014,5.0,Nice and fresh,"Good location,  the room are very big and clean,  service good and the nobu restaurant is fantastic.Very well also the spa, and the position is near the main strett of shopping and if you want to dance dowstaris there is the Armani Prive! Perfect"
241312011,November 2014,5.0,Great hotel and service,"We have spent a weekend at this beautiful hotel in Milan. The hotel is absolutely magnificent in style and design. The rooms are great. It is not your typical hotel so don't search for a big entrance and reception. It is rather reserved, elegant and discrete. Great location and super service...Simply 10 out of 10. Highly recommend it."

240159687,October 2014,4.0,Simplicity at its best.,"I did not know what to expect before staying at this hotel. Looking back at the experience I would keep my comments simple and honest. Just like the hotel. Ambiance is great at this hotel. Amenities are all good as well. Gym experience was also good. Rooms could get a little bit expensive but understandably so. Its part of the franchise. The only thing that should be looked at again is the breakfast spread. No doubt I had one of the best coffees and pancakes here its just that I hope that spread could be improved. Choices. More choices. I feel that this hotel is still living under the shadows of its elder brother, the clothing line. Step up out of it and make Armani Hotel a leading brand in the tourism industry."

217022802,July 2014,5.0,Excellent stay at a very stylish hotel,"We stayed here for one night in July 2014. Prior to our stay, I was impressed by their responsiveness and attention to detail in any correspondence. Veronica was very helpful in helping me to secure tickets for the Last Supper (tip: try to book these a couple of months in advance). We had a late arrival to the hotel at around 7pm. After entering the hotel, you have to take an elevator to the 7th floor, where the reception is located. We were celebrating our anniversary and had mentioned it when booking, and they acknowledged this and also gave us an upgrade from a Deluxe to a Premium room. They had also decorated the bed with rose petals in the shape of a heart. A nice touch!The room itself was very stylish and quite spacious. I loved the design of the room, as well as the hotel in general. However, everything is a bit dark and I imagine it would not be to everyone‚Äôs taste, so take a look at the website before you go (the actual room looked just like as represented on the website). The minibar in the room is complimentary, but this does not include any alcoholic beverages. Bottled water was plentiful however. The entrance to the bathroom was hidden at one end of the room, and the bathroom was very impressive, probably even more so than the room. The rainfall shower was excellent. Armani branded goods were scattered all over the room, ranging from the toiletries to the bedroom slippers, the minibar snacks and even the sugar cubes! There was a universal remote control from which you could adjust the lighting, music/TV, blinds, etc. It seemed fairly intuitive, but could be a bit slow to navigate at times. Our music system did not work, but we were not there long enough to bother asking them to fix it.I had a friend staying at the hotel at the same time in a Deluxe room, so I had a look around his room to compare. The layout of the room was very different, but I couldn‚Äôt say that one room was noticeably nicer than the other. The Deluxe room was a bit smaller but on the plus side it had a walk-in wardrobe. Having looked around both rooms, I‚Äôm not sure what it is that justifies the higher price for the Premium room.We visited the bar twice during our short stay ‚Äì before and after dinner. It was a very trendy venue, but was fairly quiet on a Monday evening/night. The clientele were mixed, probably a combination of hotel guests and outside visitors. Drinks prices are quite painful, with cocktails priced at around ‚Ç¨22 and upwards, or even worse non-alcoholic cocktails for ‚Ç¨18! We tried out a few different cocktails, and some of these were pretty average. On the plus side, when we there in the evening for less than an hour, they kept plying us with free nibbles (including some warm snacks such as gnocchi!). We had to stop eating in fear of spoiling our dinner! There is a city view from the bar, but it‚Äôs nothing to write home about (you are only 7 floors up). There is also a nightclub attached to the hotel, but apparently it is closed during summer.Service seemed very good during our brief stay. All of the staff seemed friendly and courteous, and I did not notice attitude from anyone. WiFi was free and worked well, even continuing to work for several hours after we had checked out. The hotel is well located in the middle of the designer shopping area, and very close to the Brera district. We went sightseeing the following day, and all key attractions were within walking distance. I am a long-term fan of the Armani brand, so perhaps I am slightly biased, but I think this was an excellent stay. Sure, it is expensive, but you get something a bit unique and I do think it was worth the cost."

209637695,June 2014,4.0,Excellent Location,"Location and personnel are excellent but certain details need to be fine tuned to correspond to the prices they charge. Lifestyle managers are not allways available as they promise they are, ground floor reception sometomes has no one there, lighting control in the romos doesn't work as it's supposed to. n the bright side, personnel are very friendly and helpful and the location is excellent."
209040814,May 2014,5.0,Incredibly stilish,Great stylish hotel at the end of the via montenapoleone within walking distance to the dome. Great 8th floor jacuzzi with city views. Bathroom equals in size the room and amenities are great.  Find the guarantee deposit weird (they take the price of the room plus 100 euros)
207871420,May 2014,3.0,A concrete bunker with style,"The best part about the hotel are the restaurant and bar - both cool,and serving exquisite food, and in the room the bed was comfy.  The down sides were checking in and out took 10/15 mins (there was no queue), my room had no mobile reception and the wifi was patchy at best not to mention it drained the battery of my phone trying to access it.  Technophobes stay away as everything is technology heavy - which I did not have a problem with.  If you want to know your in Italy or Milan, this isn't the pace for you - it's a stylish functional hotel however once inside you could be anywhere in the world."
207441877,April 2014,4.0,OTTIMO HOTEL,Hotel di lusso ma semplice da farci un soggiorno personale eccellente e preparato le camere belle ma alcune un p√≤ piccoline per il costo che hanno le camere sono arredate bene e anche quelle un po' piccoline sono comunque confortevoli bella la spa
206249250,May 2014,5.0,The best. Words can't describe. Love Armani so much,"I have been to many countries, many luxury hotels all over the world. Armani hotel is just the best. The location is perfect for shopping, the staff are atttentive, friendly. The room is woww...big, mini bars are free, wifi internet is good, the bathroom amazing, the bed is comfy. You can do almost everything in your hand remote. This is the best hotel in Europe. If I happen to come back to Milan, I will look no other than Armani Hotel. No complaints at all, maybe I just need more stilled water as I dont drink juices, soft drinks etc. I LoVe Armani so much"

200258813,April 2014,4.0,Armani all over...,"Great hotel to stay in Milan, with the Armani Soul. Modern hotel and the Armani modern touch. I missed some parts to be more colonial type, like the Armani Cafe in Boston, that is not longer operating but that I used to enjoy so much when in Newbury Street.Important, there is no parking at the hotel."

Il personale √® ben preparato ad offrire alla clientela un ottimo servizio.La SPA √® piccolina, ma le varie volte in cui sono stata non ho mai trovato troppa affluenza di persone; i trattamenti sono buoni, ma non eccezionali (manca un operatore/trice davvero bravo/a per i massaggi forti stile thailandese).Il costo della camera potrebbe essere non cos√¨ alto, non so se dipenda da politiche commerciali o dai costi fissi (struttura e personale) molto alti.

182331040,October 2013,3.0,Maybe you have to be a man,"I was looking forward to my stay at the Armani hotel in Milan. We had booked two nights in a suite. We arrived and were taken straight up to reception which is on the seventh floor. It was a light area with lovely views over Milan. The staff were very helpful and welcoming the floor was a stylish black which unfortunately marked every time somebody walked on it and a little man popped out to sweep it.We were then shown down some very dark windowless corridors on a lower floor, the walls appeared to be padded and one almost felt that someone was going to jump out and put one in a straight jacket. The lack of light and the colour of the design was quite depressing. The room doors had no handles everything was operated electronically by the room key card, which is useful. The suite itself was large but bland, dark and decorated in rather depressing colours, there were no pictures on the walls and the view out off the window was something akin to a prison camp. Good wifi connection and a complimentary non alcoholic mini bar, if you required an alcoholic drink you had to order it.The bed was absolutely blissful, the sheets were of a very high quality and the pillows extremely comfortable. The bed is not made with pillows, presumably for design sake, so if you arrive after a long flight and want to nap in the afternoon you have to find them in the cupboard.The bathroom was large and had a good walk-in shower and large bath there was minimal toiletries available.  The Armarni shower gel smell was quite manly. I never understand why a toothbrush and toothpaste is not available in these hotels since the restrictions of liquids in hand luggage. There was no body lotion on view, apparently I could've found in the drawer, I did look but I didn't find it. There was no magnifying make up mirror. The toilet floor was stained but clean.All the lighting, the television and  the curtains were operated from a remote control and from electronic panels built into the walls. If you are somewhat visually challenged and need glasses this is highly frustrating as you need to put your glasses on to read the lighting or the remote control. What is wrong with a simple light switch? I really feel that design paramount in this hotel and not ease of living or joy of life.The spa was a little disappointing there was a big square pool that was not suitable  for swimming, it had week Jacuzzi jets around two sides but no power should jets. The sauna and solarium could only seats to people there was no room to lie down and there was no ice in the sink to use for cooling down.We visited Armani nightclub below, there  did not appear to be a dance floor merely sofas and areas around them and the bar to dance or to be looked at. book a table to sit at one was expected to order at least ¬£500 of drinks, a fact the hotel staff failed to inform of us when we booked the table. The staff they were marvellous, and the bed was divine but there is something wrong when you just can't wait to get out of your room into the world beyond."
181783361,October 2013,5.0,Savour the Experience,"The Armani Milano is not a hotel, but an experience that has to savoured. Even if you have to make that trip to Milan especially to stay at The Armani, it is well worth it.Italy is the most visited country in the world, and somehow Milan gets left behind for most people. I can be sure with the presence of The Armani, it will not be so anymore. You are whisked to the 7th floor where the lobby is, very unobtrusive, very stylish. No - you do not enter into a hotel lobby like all hotels everywhere in the world. Ceiling to glass windows of breathtaking views of Milan are there for you to cherish.Different elevators take you to your rooms on lower floors. Fully automated, on a remote control, beige interiors, so stylish and understated luxury that you gasp in wonder.Each detail is designed by Mr. Armani himself right from the chess board floor in the cafe and the marble wall in the lounge. The small pebble on a Sicilian beach did not miss Mr. Armani's eye. It is replicated in the soap, the handle of the jar in the bathroom, the amenities bottle handles, the size is just right for a guest who stays 2-3 days.The spa - not to be missed - the lobby floor to ceiling glass extends upwards to the 8th floor to the spa. They have the largest Jacuzzi in the world, superb masseurs, and state of the art equipment to ensure that the experience is second to none. The food - the best tiramisu that I have had anywhere in the world. But then, it is Italian. To perfect it, in Italy, Y Not.The location of the hotel is just perfect - 5 minutes from the train station, 5 minutes from the main street where you have the high end brands as well as the local shopping. Just do not think twice, and savour the Armani experience."

175797684,August 2013,5.0,Grazie Mr Armani xoxo,"I would like to personally say GRAZIE Mr Armani for your foresight in overseeing such a large scale stunning project and giving us the experience of your design excellence.Mr Armani you ARE a genius!Our stay was faultless and absolutely the highlight hotel of our European trip. From the original footprint design of the hotel which is an A, the brand which is subtly repeated everywhere, even to the tiny personalised chocolates waiting for you on arrival. You know you are in an incredibly designed building when the foyer is on the seventh floor, your senses are immediately challenged like a beautiful piece of art. Ttwo lifts to get you to the foyer and two to the rooms, was clever and a excellent form of security, nothing was left unresolved in this creative endeavour.The suite we stayed in on the sixth floor, it was sublime with an incredible sense of refined elegance and a view of the church from our own deck. Electronic comfort for blinds, curtains, TV, and intercom door monitor, were fabulous. The rooms were acoustically thick and provided complete peace. Design layout, fixtures, towels and personal bath products in the bathroom were an interior designers dream. The free bar in our room was very generous and appreciated after a long journey, and if you want alcohol, embrace the Milanese way and go to the spectacular bar on the seventh floor for a decadent cocktail in arguably one of the most elegant bars I have ever had a drink in!We headed up to the spa on the eighth floor for a couples massage, spa and sauna  - WOW, truly  the ultimate in refined elegance and exceptional design, yet again. My husband stuck his head into the gym, he was instantly transported to gym nirvana, grazie Mr Armani.The signature restaurant had magnificent food and impeccable service. I was especially impressed by the little bed on the side of the table for my handbag to luxuriated on while I dined- grazie Mr Armani! Back to our sweet suite the bed, pillows and beautiful sheets floated us off to sleep.Breakfast was once again elegant, the buffet breakfast with exceptional. Only the best food sourced by Mr Armani was presented with the refined restraint of a Japanes garden. Cooked food was made to order for the freshest quality - no bain marees here, grazie Mr Armani!At thi point, did we really want to explore outside?We forced ourselves to pop downstairs and explore everything Armani on ground level, so into the Armani Florist we went,  where exquisite works of art were being created, perfect displays of  A chocolates waited to be purchased. The Armani bookshop and shopping galleria where further enticements beaconed kept us occupIed.GRAZIE Mr Armani for allowing us to experience your creative design genius, we had an an forgettable stay!

166540557,July 2013,4.0,Very peaceful,"I am not a fashion guy so I was dreading our stay here. However, I was wrong. One of the most peaceful city hotels I have ever stayed at. The rooms are very interesting, unique and incredibly comfortable. Just a really cool place with nice staff and a great location."
165200719,June 2013,4.0,"Lots of pros, but has some cons in the rooms","A lot of aspects here are impressive - they have a smooth, flat surface theme throughout: doors are just a ligher shading, no handles, blend into the corridors and distinguished by just an outline. Plenty of cool gadgetry throughout, such as 1 way mirrors in the bathroom, lighting, flat screen TV that disappears into a stand. The room floorplan at least in my 6th fl room was very poor, however: it was very crammed with maybe a foot & a half max of space between the desk and the armoir to get to the window/balcony, unless you climb over the bed; you also could only get into the closet after squeezing into this spot next to the desk. Quite awkward.Complimentary minibar was great, although not much of interest there. I'm also not much of a fan of hotels with an upstairs lobby.Hotel makes up for the cons with the good location (5 min walk from Duomo) and, for the most part, very good staff service."
164163804,June 2013,5.0,Super Chic,"Este Hotel es super lindo, ultra moderno y muy bien situado. El ambiente es agradable y la atencion fue de primera. Solo pasamos un a noche en este hotel pero la experiencia fue muy agradable. Nos quedamos con ganas de volver a este hotel."
160639685,May 2013,5.0,"more than a stay at a 5+ star hotel, this was a wonderful life experience","I think I have never been more enthusiastic about EVERYTHING (with two exceptions which I will mention later) in a hotel.  Indeed during and still now days later I feel more as if I had a wonderful life-altering experience.  Simply stated, GIORGIO ARMANI! I find myself saying ""Giorgio for President, Giorgio for President of the World"".  Every aspect of the hotel has been marked my Mr. Armani's hand; one senses it immediately when the impeccable, good-looking and exquisitely appointed young man opens the big glass doors to the entrance lobby, understatedly smiling and welcoming,  and where one is immediately immersed in a wonderful natural perfume which is the signature perfume found in all the products including many in the Spa.Another aspect,  already noted during a trip to the restaurant a while back, is the staff.  They are all so well-trained.  Chatting with them will reveal what so clearly transpires; they are part of an Armani ""family"", it seems, all knowingly enlightened by Mr. Armani HIMSELF, and one senses also in speaking to them, and in watching how they move, how they work, how they go about performing their work, with competence, elegance, and reserved warmth/serenity, that the font of all this comes from HIM.  I think that each person I had spoken to mentioned that Mr. Armani comes regularly, knows each employee, and has sat down with each of them.  His attention to detail must be borderline maniacal and the result is total ease and elegance, purity of line and spirit, everywhere.  One person told me that Mr. Armani also provides indications as to precisely where on an end table the lamp is to be positioned and where the small dish.  All this contributes to the overwhelming sense of appreciation I came away with after having had the pleasure of experiencing a day a night another day in these realms.  Our room, which I HIGHLY recommend, no. 605, was on the corner and had a wrap around balcony.  Everything in the room is James Bondishly commanded by a fepper which raises and lowers the blinds, curtains, lights, entertainment (I LOVE that! Why don't I have this in my life???) Immediately one feels projected into a delicate, easy, high-tech enviornment and then one begins to look around, and to feel.  The decor is all very relaxing and tranquilizing, dazzling in its simplicity and cleanliness of line.  The rooms contain a mini-bar which includes, at no extra charge, soft drinks, juices and snacks and I have never seen that in a normal hotel room.  The furnishings are so well-designed and the drawers that contain the cups for cappuccino and espresso represent the ultimate luxury; specially built concavities to house, individually, 2 cappucino cups, 2 espresso cups, and their saucers AND spoons (see picture).  The plates designed with a beautiful golden duomo.  Not to mention the ""A"" engraved sugar cubes (in white and cane), and which are flattened sugar cubes.  Even the sugar cubes are creative and specially designed!  (Tea bags too, have sewn-on Armani-designed touches.)We had a spectacular view of Via Manzoni and the Duomo, Via Montenapoleone.  We enjoyed the night time air on the balcony, which also was simply and elegantly appointed with a special bamboo plant which gave a pretty natural feel. The bathrooms have glass doors that you can see out of but not into.  The materials used in the bathrooms are a stone or marble, intelligently designed shower with a cut out that serves as a ledge for products.  A cut-out ledge also lined the entire length of the tub and had indirect lighting.  The soap is in the shape of a river stone, and the soap dish is a simple cube with a hole for drainage so that you don't wind up with that pasty soap effect that badly designed soap dishes yield.  I know it is (only) a soap dish BUT look at what has gone into that soap dish!  It demonstrates that someone, in this case Mr. Armani and/or his team, put thought into what a soap dish should be, how it should look, what it should be made of etc.  Functionality, elegance, beauty, simplicity.  One has to appreciate the effort that goes into beautifying and improve all the moments of daily existence which make up our days and years and lives.  Ergo I appreciate Mr. A.Our room had a circular entry way with an indirectly lit ceiling light surrounding the round, a curved table, and curved doors that could be kept open or closed.  It is a tiny elegant space and so surprising one almost doesn't notice it so under-toned and simple in its design.  This is what makes it so appealing and appreciable.  Hour by hour I found myself appreciating and praising and oohing and ahhing over this potent force,  what genial, dedicated, attention to detail focused person could possibly have done to achieve such a uniformly excellent ambiance?  Anyone who has had work done on a house knows the battle and disappointment when workmanship is simply not up to snuff or is outright incompetent.  Crookedly grouted tiles, mistaken inclines, badly jointed walls or floors or furniture.  One's eye goes right to the error, and every time one looks at it, one experiences bile and grief.  Eventually, to maintain sanity, one ignores or re-spends the money to repair.  In the Armani Hotel, everywhere you look you see perfection in workmanship.  Perfectly joined and matched marble in the curved Spa wall is AWESOME!  The marble blocks themselves are cut on a curve!  It is beautiful and amazing and I appreciated it completely.  The Spa is on the 8th floor and has a super-sized jacuzzi (which i did not experience) and steam and sauna rooms.  The area is adorned by towel racks, designed of course by Mr. Armani my absolute new guru of life, in the form of Japanese gates.  They are painted deep forest green and go with the the other featured minimal furnishings in the bar area.  The carpet runner on the slightly curved tadao andoesque (oh no will he kill me for this?) corridors are covered with a tatami-like but durable enough for lots of traffic material absolutely fresh looking and lovely.  There are gorgeous bamboo decorated glass doors.  One of the staff members told me that Mr. A does love and appreciate everything Japanese, and he designed his lamps from a Japanese inspiration.If you love design and cleanliness, you must come here if only to look and feel inspired and renewed.The restaurant:  We had another very pleasant restaurant experience.  Staff courteous, knowledgable, and efficient.  I had an EXQUISITE pea soup, my husband enjoyed a raviolo.  Our secondi were frankly not so great; a take on cotelletta Milanese made with cernia.  It was bland and could have been avoided.  It was tiny so we didn't feel stuffed.  Of course, it wasn't inexpensive, but everything else we ate was delicious.  We ordered a litre of Radikon from Oslavje from Venezia Giulia; divine.The proof of the power of this experience was that I went home and found myself dumping the contents of kitchen drawers, and, while attempting to channel Mr. A, found myself saying, ""what would Giorgio say about this spoon? It's just going to have to go..."" and now I can boast beautifully manicured for contents kitchen drawers, well, almost.  If only this level of attention, care, elegance and love could be transmitted to the entire planet we would live in beautiful peace. OH, the negatives; the wifi didn't always work; and even Mr. Armani has those bloody noisy printers in the restaurant whose horrible printy back and forth back and forth buzz buzz buzz is amplified by the space and is just an annoying detraction.  Heard it at breakfast not at dinner.  Don't they believe in either laser printers or getting these printers OFF the floor behind one of their gorgeous doors? I had a look at some of the other reviews and am astounded to read that others had bad service.  It took me about 13 minutes to receive my trolley. Armani for President.  And, I changed my name. I am now, Melanie Armani.  I wanna BE Armani."

154216471,September 2012,5.0,Amazing Minimalistic Hotel,"This hotel is something. We had once a normal room for private and one time the suite.Standard room is simply amazing. This hotel has no big frames or paintings or plants like other hotels. Minimalistic totally. Its all about fabrics on the floor, wall and lights. Grey is not my colour but it looks amazing there. Rooms offer all the things you need for shower, coffe and the beds are more than soft. The big suite has a massive stair going up. with a minimal lightning and amazing simple furniture. If somebody rings on the doorbell it shows you on the TV. Flowers everywhere, amazing smell, middle of the luxury boutiques. Enjoy this magical masterpiece hotel. The wood barr is also amazing. the light is on the floor. Very warm colours and stuff is incredible."
152932074,February 2013,4.0,Great staff...  'shining' ambiance,"Overall: the service was pleasant and welcoming. The room (executive deluxe on 6th floor) was clean and quiet (with a balcony but the view was nothing exceptional). However we will not be back as the overall ambiance of the hotel was cold (starting from the ground floor lobby - which resembles more a typical italian apartments complex entrance rather than a 5 *****L hotel- to the restaurant which resembled more a luxury cafeteria) and the same time  soffocating and unsettling (our room was overly decorated with little space to move around; in addition never experienced such unfriendly, featurless corridors to the point that the next morning we felt the urge of exiting the hotel in a rush to experience normality again). Positive: the reception staff was very professional and attentive; the greeting in the street entrance was prompt and corteous. The breakfast offered a good variety of food with some local specialties (top quality ingredients). The room was spotless and the bed confortable. Negative: As mentioned before the main negative for us was the overall design of the hotel. We feel that a hotel should offer confortable, relaxing and inspiring environments and more than anything a home away from home. In our opinion this hotel instead offered (for the deluxe room) a soffocating experience while the minimalist approach was so excessive for the common areas it become synonym for scarcity and desolation."
150796550,November 2012,5.0,My favorite hotel in the world,"If you are going to be in Milan this is the only hotel to stay at. Not only are the accomodations beautiful but the staff is amazing. Everyone refers to you by your name and they truly make you feel at home. I was lucky enough to spend my birthday there and when I was leaving for the day my favorite doorman, a lovely young man from Sicily, smiled at me sincerely and said ""Good morning and happy birthday. I hope you have a great day!"" The front desk must have noticed my date of birth on my passport. This small and unexpected gesture truly made my birthday even more special. This is the definitinon of hospitality. I travel frequently for business purposes and I have never felt more welcome, pampered, and taken care of than I did during the week I stayed at Armani Hotel Milano."
150158569,January 2013,5.0,You cant do much better,"Armani Style, TOP. for many the technology in the rooms might be a bit too much. rooms are great, well maintained and just the best in Milano.Try to get one of the room with a little outside space. its just perfect when the sun is out. The location could not be an better. what was once the Bulgari Hotel ( many years ago) is now the Armani."
149556403,December 2012,4.0,very nice place,"It's a nice hotel - luxury . The rooms are well designed, also in the center very close to the main shopping area. Good spot to stay in Milan ! I would suggest this hotel to anyone who have a large budget and likes to feel relaxed"
149510269,January 2013,5.0,Da Vinci code!,"This time we decided to change our residence in Milan and it was really worth it! It seems as if there is a mystery to solve as you walk along the hotel corridors!The room doors look like part of the wall with no door knobs-just a touch with your key-card opens them.The reception is on the seventh floor where you take another elevator to get to  the rooms.The rooms are really something from the future!You can manage everything with a remote control(TV,air con,drapes,lights etc).The room decoration is very modern,stylish and minimal.The views from our room (5th floor) as well as the  room service, the staff and the daily free refreshments and sweet bits were excellent.I would definitely go back again!"
147082500,July 2012,3.0,I hated it,We went to Milan in the summer and it was not the first time because we love the city and we always stay in Italian hotels so we choosed Armani for it's location. We had to go in a left to the reception area the take another left to the rooms from there. The front desk staffs works as everything even as concierge. They are the worse ever they cant recommend good nearby restaurants or mall or times for famous tourist attraction that we founded by our self. Things we can find in 3 stars hotels in all Europe how about 5 star one such as Armani. Milan is a hot city in the summer but the air-condition in this hotel is not that cold as they said it's complicated and they can't modify it. This hotel is only about location its great if you're thinking about this hotel visit Milan in the winter and study the area yourself then go.
146376021,November 2012,4.0,Classy Milan venue,"Milan has a reputation for style and fashion, the Armani hotel is certainly one of the most fashionable places to experience it. I popped into the 7th floor cocktail bar this week for pre dinner cocktails this week. We were seated very quickly and imediatly offered a complimary drinks of rose wine. I ordered a Park Avenue which was delivered very promptly accompanied by a constant supply of complementary apperative snacks. I followed this up with two excellent Hendricks and tonics over, the following hour and a half , all acompaning by so many snacks I lost count (and in fact in negated my appetite for a starter later that night at dinner!)If you want to see Milan at its most funky and fashionable drop in for pre dinner drinks."

However I had a fabulous stay at his hotel. The Rooms are spacious and v well appointed. I had a service issue which the hotel put right entirely to my satisfaction can't ask for more.

143867884,October 2012,5.0,Albergo di estremo fascino con il massimo dei confort,"Albergo di un'eleganza sofisticata in perfetto stile Armani impreziosita da soluzioni architettoniche e di arredamento innovative sto all'imbocco di via Montenapoleone. L'ingresso sempre presidiato dal personale √® quello di un condominio di lusso, senza inutile sfarzo di marmi, cristalli e velluti. La reception si trova sul settimo piano. Nei corridoi che conducono alle camere luci soffuse e tappezzerie scure favoriscono il rilassamento. La camera de luxe corredata di balcone √® spaziosa ed arredata con mobili e tappezzeria di creazione Armani dalle linee eleganti. Il bagno in piastrelle di travertino dispone di un'ampia vasca e di una grande cabina doccia. Un unico telecomando consente di controllare l'aria condizionata, le tende, le luci e la televisione, ma sono previsti anche comandi a parete per chi √® meno pratico. Attenzione al segnale Do Not Disturb (DND). Lo abbiamo lasciato inserito e non ci hanno rifatto la camera. Pertanto abbiamo poi atteso dalle 13 alle 15.30 prima che la rifacessero (unica pecca !). Il set di cortesia tanto nella camera, quanto nel bagno presenta un ricchissimo assortimento fra cui sfiziose pantofole nere. La luminosa sala colazione adibita la sera a ristorante offre una impareggiabie vista a 180 gradi su Milano dalle vetrate che girano tutt'intorno. L'offerta comprende un'ampia scelta di piccola pasticceria, frutta, jogurt, formaggi, mentre il salato √® su richiesta. Il servizio in camera √® impeccabile e professionale. L'albergo dispone di un centro benessere dotato di sauna, bagno turco, piscina idromassaggio e un'ampia palestra. Il prezzo √® adeguato al livello dell'albergo, ma inferiore a quello di altri alberghi di pari livello."
143607436,October 2012,5.0,Just about Perfect,"6 nights in a Premier room and loved every aspect of this hotel. Yes it is pricey but you get a lot for your money. High quality fittings and furnishings, right down to heated bathroom floors for cold feet on an autumn morning. Staff appear to be carefully recruited for attitude and responsiveness. Less than 100 rooms and you never fell like their are crowds of guests. Spotlessly clean. Lovely skin care products.  Excellent gym. Only two slight criticisms; room service portion sizes were a little small; and like most European cities, street noise from rubbish collectors in the early mornings (despite double glazing) will wake light sleepers, so if you are very sensitive to noise make sure you ask for a quiet room on check-in. One of the best out of a few hundred hotels I've stayed at."
142807538,October 2012,4.0,Milan must be proud to have such a property,"It's totally different from every hotel I've ever been in my life. The reception was in the 7th floor next to the lounge bar and restaurant and my room was in the 4th floor. The style , the colour, the materials, the design are extremely elegant. My room was a suite was spacy with living room , a bedroom and a huge bathroom full of Armani bath-staf. The location is ideal just next to via Montenapoleone and five minutes walk to Galeria. All people work for the hotel are very gentle and willingness to fulfill your desires. Try the restaurant in the 7th floor despite it's expensive is worth to have the experience."
142317552,October 2012,5.0,An absolute treat!,"To end my exhausting 3 week stay in Italy on a high note, I chose to stay at the fabulous Armani Hotel, Milan for 2 nights (4 - 6 October 2012). The hotel far surpassed my expectations and I felt as if I had died and gone to heaven! The welcome greeting at the entrance was √ºber friendly and efficient. I saw my luggage disappear while being escorted to the lift and to the reception. Within minutes, I was following my impeccably dressed lifestyle manager to my room. A short while later, my luggage arrived, carried by the best looking and most cheerful porter I've ever encountered on my travels :) !  The uncluttered interior decor reflects the crisp clean lines Mr Armani is famous for! As a single traveller, I booked a premier room (412), which was more than adequate for my needs.  The room was sumptuous, the bathroom out of this world and the technology very impressive. Congratulations to Mr Armani for creating such a wonderful stylish space for a tired traveller! Wish I could have stayed longer! Will surely be back - soon!"

My lifestyle manager, Antonio, greeted me by name everytime I walked in the door and attended to every detail of my stay.    The hotel is top notch!!!   The bed is the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  The room is sooo quiet and although the remote system takes a little getting used to, once I got the hang of it I loved it!!! I love the rain shower and the Armani products (although I long for hair conditioner).   I had one issue that has yet to be resolved.   I had a bag with gifts for my Birthday...   One scarf from Armani (which I loved) and one from Dolce and Gabbana.   I had to take assist my friend with something in her room and left the sack (which was not in great shape) in the Vestubile.   The Housekeeper apparently though it was trashed and removed it.   :(  They took my e-mail, so I am sure I will be hearing from them soon! I loved the hotel! :)"
138946950,August 2012,5.0,Beauty of style,"During my two weeks summer retreat, we have stayed at Armani Hotel Milano for two nights. My reservation was a classic suit room. However thanks to generosity of the hotel management, we were upgraded to Ambassador suite room. This is an amazing hotel in a sense that Mr. Armani expressed his own aesthetic values to the degree unimaginable. I am truly astonished to realize that there is at least single person who pursue his value system without any compromise (i.e., Something like a hotel version of his private house). Because of extremity, some people may love it but others may not. This is fine. Fine culture is not for everyone. Anyway, if you are an Armanist, this is the place you should visit at least once in your life. Around the wall of the living room was placed with panels of special touch feeling. Between the panels, light is embedded. In the evening and night, the room itself is irradiating. This is very expensive and gorgeous while maintaining the beauty of simplicity. All the furniture is Armani Casa or specially designed. Coffee cups in the room were Meissen with golden Armani log. Another surprise is storage. Most items are beautifully stored. This reminded me of an episode of Film Director Kurosawa. Whenever he takes a movie, we asked staff members to put top notch products in the closets (even when there is no plan to open the drawers). He believed that good karma would emanate from inside. Mr. Armani brought in such a stylistic beauty to this hotel. Some scent is added to the air conditioning. TV and telephone systems are the same as Armani Hotel Dubai and you can control virtually almost all electric equipment at hand. This is a world of Italian technology. Male hotel staffs are in general, tall, macho and good-looking which may reflect personal preference. Female staffs are also beautiful. I specifically likened a lady at fitness studio."

From the moment you arrive you are greeted by him and her and given a detailed tour of the hotel and your guest room.  I soon felt like I had a  ""friend"" I could call with any issue I had.The hotels are done in typical high-Armani style, and you can tell that a lot of love went into all the details from the Maestro himself.  High end architecture, furniture and materials, a perfect bed, a perfect bathroom, with the most beautiful glass doors,  and wonderful lighting throughout.  The hotel has Mr. Armani's favorite scent ""Bois D'encens"" in the air, as well as in the beautifully designed bathroom toiletries.  Not one detail is left to chance, and I could easily have simply moved in there for a few months and would have been very happy.When you send your clothes to be laundered it miraculously arrives sealed in plastic and looking brand new.The hotel is literally steps from VIA MONTENAPOLEONE and all the famous shopping.The spa has a giant jacuzzi with a view of IL DUOMO cathedral.This is a hotel designed by a man who clearly loves hotels.The only complaint I had was with having to ask for a code to sign on to the internet daily, hopefully this will be fixed soon."

I servizi sono impeccabili: dalla reception alla pulizia camere, fino al ristorante, con uno chef di prim'ordine e camerieri di altissimo livello.

970071654,August 2024,1.0,Horrible Experience - Stay Away!,"I recently stayed at what I thought would be a top-tier luxury hotel Armani in Milan, but my experience was far from it. During my stay, my wallet was stolen, and instead of offering any assistance, or even sympathy, the hotel staff was incredibly rude and dismissive. When I reported the theft, they showed no concern and were utterly unhelpful in trying to resolve the situation. It took hours for them to contact the police and they offered no assistance in investigating the matter further. Instead, they made it seem like I was the problem. They claim to have shown me video evidence that the theft didn't happen in the room - this is a complete fabrication - they never showed me any video at all and I was told that no videos of the rooms exist. For a hotel that charges premium rates and claims to be ‚Äúluxury,‚Äù their customer service was shockingly poor. I expected much better from a hotel of this supposed caliber, and I would strongly advise anyone to stay elsewhere if they want a pleasant and secure experience in Milan. Failed security, unsafe premises, terrible service, rude staff, and an overall disgraceful experience."
966867731,August 2024,1.0,no support,"I was booked at the hotel last week and had my wallet stolen from the room. I had all of my identification and credit cards in it, the lack of which made my trip an ordeal.  No one had access to the room other than housekeeping but the hotel defends their staff and was unsupportive throughout the whole process of filing a police report and communicating with us as the resolution of our problem. One would expect that when a hotel has a guest from a foreign country who is unfamiliar with their surroundings in terms of custom and language would be much more attentive to their plight in such difficult circumstances. Sadly that was not the case here either in action or sentiment."

953486775,June 2024,5.0,Exceptional hotel and service,"I have never left a review before the end of my stay, but felt compelled to do so for the Armani hotel based on my pre-checkin experience and interactions with the hotel which have held true post checkin. 1. Exceptional general manager - i had visited Milan previously and enjoyed our stay at the Park Hyatt. However, wanted a different experience this time and the general manager was highly responsive and easily managed to give me a sense of what was to come with the Armani team - welcoming and highly responsive  as well as considerate. It starts from the top - thank you Danielle!2. Amazing concierge team - I was traveling with a large group of my family and had particular logistical issues the day before I arrived including needing a rental car I could take a lot of luggage in from malpensa to Verona and then dropping off the car at the hotel in Milan. I was not even a guest at the hotel yet and no request was turned down. Car was arranged and managed wonderfully and several other logistical issues were ironed out well before we arrived at the hotel. 3.  Checkin and Room - checkin was a breeze and the hotel is amazing. Beautifully modern and while highly technical in room controls etc., previous reviews on their complexity are highly exaggerated. My dad in his 70‚Äôs figured it out quickly.We stayed  in a beautiful Ambassador suite and to have this much space in the heart of Milan, a stone throw away from the Duomo is a privilege. We have not completed our stay yet, but excited to see how this continues  to be a great experience. The bar is definitely set very high :)Thank you Danielle and the Armani team for your wonderful hospitality!PS - if you are thinking Armani and Milan, perhaps cold and pretentious service - you would be wrong. We have stayed at the best hotels in the world and like warm hospitality in service and attitude. Armani delivers!"

902780939,July 2023,5.0,Modernist Milano,"The Armani is a strikingly modern hotel in the heart of beautiful Milan. While extremely comfortable and well-appointed, it took a bit of work to get used to the iPad managed controls for everything from lights to televisions to doors. It is perfect for those who are very comfortable with technology. You enter on the ground floor and then take an elevator up to 7th floor reception. From there you take another elevator back down or up to your floor to find your room. It would have been helpful for someone to show us how the room worked, and even how to open the door, but that did not happen. We spent way too much time trying to figure out how the room worked. The mini-bar was complementary and we had a voucher for room service which we used. The three-story Armani store is just down the street from the hotel. The included breakfast was nice, but service was slow. The Concierge desk not very helpful either. Overall, an interesting but very non-traditional experience. When in Milan, I would prefer to see the sights not spend time on how to turn off the lights to go to sleep."

The ARMANI hotel is how a hotel should be - we assume that the name giver has probably collected all the experience he made in his life at all the hotels in the world and used this as the 'guideline' for his own version.The rooms are spacious with all the things you need, the bed is extremely comfortable with special lining from various parts of the world, bathroom stunning and all items are in the Armani style.The hotel rooms are quiet which is not always the case even in 5* hotels as the rooms have their own little lobby which provides as well noise insulation. The housekeeping staff moves and works quietly and the doors/elevators etc seem to work without any sound.Common areas such as restaurant, breakfastroom, bar etc are comfortable and well designed and offer huge variety.Location is central and in walking distance to La Scala, Shopping district and Dome.A hotel as a hotel should be..."

637943565,December 2018,1.0,Kinda Terrible Movie Stage !!!,"have had my very positive and luxurious dreams about the name of ARMANI, which has become an horrible experience after this trip.I felt like i was in cheap Hollywood Movie stage where the front of the buildings are superior with an absurd odd rear end. Room was super tight and small that made me feel that there is lack of oxygen. I stayed in a 50 m2 room with a feeling of 15 m2 due to an horrible architecture i even had to open my luggage in a bathroom  Everything in the room was very old and has never been taken care since the first day. I have to admit that i am an often traveller and always stay in upscale hotels all over the world. I have missed my stays in other Milan hotels that i will not mention name's here. But listen, one good thing is that you made me become a Trip advisor member ! And No More Armani Forever !"

592609190,May 2018,5.0,Thoroughly enjoyed this property!!!,"I normally try to stay in classic hotels as opposed to modern hotels given a choice.  I was extremely happy that I chose to stay in the Armani Hotel Milano.The exterior of the building doesn't do it justice.  It is a somewhat non descript modern building without any particular character.  Once you steps though the doors, that all changes.The hotel staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  They went out of their way to make us feel at home and comfortable.  The lobby is not particularly interesting, but well staffed and efficient, and with service with a smile.  The Armani scent was omnipresent throughout the hotel, and was very welcome.The bar has wide vistas, and nice music and drinks.The room was amazing!  The bed very comfortable, the bathroom spacious and provided every modern convenience.  Complimentary drinks and snacks are a nice touch.  The toiletries are Armani with a clean woodsy scent.An ipad controls automation throughout the room, and while it is interesting and effective, I may have preferred standard room controls.The location is a 7 minute walk to the center of Brera and not much more to the Duomo.

If your a fan of Armani fragrances, you will love this hotel. The Hotel baffles you in a good way, you take the elevator to recption, which you assume would be on level 1, but its actually level 7 - all the bedrooms are on the floors below. The concept behind this is to give fabulous views from reception and the restaurant across Milan.The bedroom was just total luxury, the smell, accessories and bathroom. The cafe was expensive, but delicious - the spa is pure luxury and based on the 8th floor with incredible views of Milan."

565179786,March 2018,4.0,Very nice and modern!,"I have stayed for 3 nights in the hotel. I had a beautiful suite, went to the spa for massage. I choose a woman and I did not really like it. Better ask for Male. You will enjoy the breakfast for sure and you should absolutely try the restaurant. I will post the pictures. Very tasty food. The concierge is very kind and helpful. The hotel is on a high level, very modern, with a gym. Only little suggestion. The housekeeper and mini bar services are coming to the room, that I did not even hear them coming. They were disturbing me 3 times per day, by waking me up walking in when I‚Äôm taking shower etc. It should be absolutely changed. What I did not like is that the hotel is very dark inside.

Mit dem Romantik Packet kamen wir neben einem exquisiten Abendessen, dem grandiosen Fr√ºhst√ºck auch in den Genuss des Spa mit tollen Anwendungen. Zu guter letzt k√∂nnten wir das Zimmer bis 15h am Folgetag halten. Allerdings sind knapp 1300‚Ç¨ schon sehr happig - jedoch jeden Euro wert wenn man einmal f√ºr 24h in den Luxus dieses Designtraumes Abtauchen m√∂chte. Die Minibar ist zu diesem Preis ebenfalls enthalten ;-) Das Personal ist sehr zuvorkommend und begleitet die ahnungslosen und mitunter √ºberforderteren G√§ste zu jeder gew√ºnschten Destination. Etwas ungewohnt ist die Lobby im 7 Stockwerk und der Lift Wechsel wenn man in sein Zimmer m√∂chte die alle unterhalb liegen. Absolut empfehlenswert"

525664531,September 2017,1.0,Imperdo√°vel! Armani espetacular como estilista,"Ficamos hospedados de 7 a 11 de setembro. A primeira surpresa foi um ""Up grade"" que n√£o nos agradou nem um pouco - reclamamos com a recep√ß√£o, tendo em vista que a su√≠te que nos ofereceram tinha dois ambientes o que tornava o quarto claustrof√≥bico, mas j√° n√£o era poss√≠vel fazer nada naquele dia. No dia seguinte nos mudaram de apto - este sim, com uma vista muito bonita, mas com detalhes de fazer chorar: 1) Sentado na cadeira na varanda vc n√£o consegue ver a vista (s√≥ plantas) - muito mal projetado 2) O apto tem mais corredor q √°rea √∫til 3) o vidro da varanda estava quebrado e ng n√£o deu nenhuma satisfa√ß√£o.Tivemos por motivos de sa√∫de que prorrogar nossa estada. A recepcao disse q n√£o havia mais aptos, apesar disso reservamos via Booking a mesma categoria de apto q est√°vamos - mesmo assim n√£o nos deixaram ficar no apto (meu companheiro estava sem andar) - ok, o gerente explicou q era uma fam√≠lia e entendemos. Colocaram-nos num apto praticamente sem janelas (virado para o pr√≥prio Predio) - aten√ß√£o a grande parte dos aptos s√£o assim! O apto no tinha banheira conforme reservamos pela Booking. O quarto tem itens de acabamento bonitos, um hall ""redondo"" que foi a √∫nica coisa que realmente impressionou, sistema td informatizado via iPad. O servi√ßo de room service e bar s√£o bons, o Roof Top tem atendimento atencioso e as massas ""contempor√¢neas"" s√£o boas. O menu degusta√ß√£o ou os pratos do restaurante ""estrelado"" n√£o valem nada, servi√ßo confuso, tumultuado, muito melhor o do bar ou pedir room service...

524957869,September 2017,5.0,Armani hotel. Best in Milano,Excellent hotel with everything one could dream of.  We had many other options yet we come back to the Armani every time. The location as well as the ambiance are unique and memorable. We tell our friends to stay at the Armani many still go to the mandarin for their parking situation and oriental style. We prefer the Armani.
523808732,September 2017,5.0,Amazing,"It was a great stay at the hotel. Great design, best hotel in milano ! Rooms are spacious,luxury and everything is Armani. Who doesn't like Giorgio Armani ?! Look at the picture, you will love it when you experience it !"
521315974,September 2017,4.0,Probably the best value during Formula One Weekend,"When room rates in Milan are hitting sky high prices because it's such a busy weekend, the Amani provided relatively good value for money.Unfortunately there were some imperfections but it was all round a decent, albeit still expensive stay.Check in - I was able to check in before the official check in time and the staff were very helpful in this regard.I was having difficulty booking tickets on an external website to go to the outlet mall.  A gentlemen staff member was very gracious in assisting me to book the ticket however I was surprised that they charge a 2 euro commission for this - based on my experience, concierge assistance making reservations and booking tickets is standard hotel service.  Given the room rate for this hotel, it's hard to feel like you're not being nickel and dimed when such a petty charge is directed at the guest.Staff at the front desk were mostly professional but I was disappointed to see a woman make a face to her colleague and gesture at luggage left for storage by another guest.  Ideally don't diss the guests but if you must, do it behind closed doors.Staff at the front desk later were quite difficult towards me when I arrived to ask to be pointed in the direction of the restaurant for my dinner reservation.  They asked me which restaurant and I said your two Michelin star restaurant.  They insisted that there was nothing in my notes about having a reservation and in any event all Michelin star restaurants were closed on Sundays.  Eventually they worked out that they were in the wrong and not only was their restaurant open, but I did have a reservation (there was almost no one there so I could have been seated anyway).  This was totally unnecessary had staff had any idea of what was going on in their own hotel - it's not like there are so many restaurants it's hard to keep track and being suspicious about what I was telling them without verifying whether I might be correct, was annoying.The room itself was nice enough with a good view out onto a church.  Like the Armani hotel in Dubai, the mini bar is complimentary which is a good perk.Spa: Treatments were good and price point was fair.  Unfortunately I had difficulty communicating to the nail technician that she had filed through my skin when removing semi permanent polish which left me with my skin sliced open on several of my fingers and the sting of pain when the nail polish remover was applied to the open wound was not pleasant at all.   I loved that the steam rooms were individual cabins - I have never seen that before!Restaurant: After finally making it inside, this was a pleasant enough place with good service.  This is just personal taste but I thought the food was overly salty so while it was a nice experience, I wouldn't go out of my way to return.Check out: Around 100 euros extra had been charged to my room.  The restaurant had made a mistake in allocating someone else's bill to me.  I had to point out that the signature was not mine at all - in addition to repeatedly saying, those aren't my drinks.A hotel of this caliber and this price point really should have less errors and staff who are 100% gracious towards guests.  While the stay was not terrible, I do hope that this feedback will help with the quality for future stays - when we save up for a vacation and throw loads of money down, it should be a special experience."

Ho stuzzicato qualcosa di veloce al bar che riserva roba ottima e di qualit√†, dalle bevande al cibo! La SpA si √® confermata rigenerante, essendo situata in cima alla struttura e mostrando una vista di Milano mozzafiato e stranamente silenziosa! Anche le camere perfette ..se nn fosse che se sono dotate di un asciugacapelli ...inappropriato allo standard altissimo che l'Armanl hotel rivela in tutto il resto: un phon attaccato ad una presa e quindi utilizzabile esclusivamente nel bagno nei pressi dello specchio ma , soprattutto, un phon che funziona soltanto continuando a premere ( senza mai lasciarlo) il pulsante di accensione! 4 punti e nn 5 perch√© pur ribadendo l'ottimo giudizio su tutto il resto, alla luce della piccola critica, non posso ovviamente dare il massimo!"

It so happened that it was the 5th anniversary of the hotel, and we were graciously invited to join in the celebration at the bar.  Well appointed room with a balcony, complimentary mini bar with snacks, and a beautiful bathroom made our stay very memorable.  Just a little annoyance was the TV cabinet at the foot of our bed, kind of restricted movement in the room."
440552258,November 2016,4.0,One of favorites in Milan!,"The hotel experience was very nice. I absolutely adored the design, provided bathroom things were all with Armani perfume and all included room bar. As well as I loved how big the bathroom was. Unfortunately the closet was very weird, it was less than a meter tall or something like that and even my boyfriends jackets couldn't hang fully, not even talking about my dresses... Also there weren't any space were to put our shoes so the nice design (absolutely my favorite was the hidden TV in a room and IPad music, light and etc. control available when you're already in bed) wasn't that comfortable for use. As well it took quite a long time to get our car even though we always called from the room to take it."

It was so relaxing from lighting, colors and beautiful peppery frankincense smell, that you can not buy the lotion and shampoo in store. The bathroom floors were heated. The spa over looks the city and the massage absolutely topped up my experience with Armani. If you come to Milan this is the only hotel you should go for."

420895208,September 2016,1.0,Pior hotel que j√° fiquei na vida,"Vim para Mil√£o a trabalho e escolhi o hotel Armani pela localiza√ß√£o e conforto. Selecionei um quarto que era mil euros mais caro do que o mesmo quarto com cama de casal, pois estava viajando com uma colega de trabalho e n√£o queriamos dormir juntas. Ao chegar, no quarto tinha 1 cama de casal onde eles apenas trocaram os len√ßois e chamaram aquilo de 2 camas. Conversei com o gerente e disse que nao entendia porque eles cobravam mais caro uma vez que nao era um quarto com duas camas. No fim, ele disse que nada podia fazer pois o hotel estava lotado. Ele acabou colocando uma bi cama, o que na minha cabe√ßa n√£o justifica os mil euros. Logo depois quis conhecer as facilidades do hotel como piscina e sala de ginastica e fui barrada na porta da piscina pois nao estava com trajes de banho e minha entrada iria constranger os h√≥spedes. Nunca vi tanta babozeira e tantos funcion√°rios mal educados na minha vida. Hotel caro com pessoas que tratam os h√≥spedes com pouco caso e falta de educa√ß√£o. N√£o indico!"

The hotel comes with the panoramic views from the Duomo to Milan's beautiful architectures. Armani made me feel very classy, calm and vibrant at the same time. Love all staffs treatments here especially at the spa with steam bath and sauna after long day of spending (too much). Also a very relaxing time with nicely serenade live music at the Bamboo bar ;)"

Overall it was a great experience except that the room does not have a good sound proof as I was being arranged with a connecting room and I can hear the next door conversation.  Also the door was very heavy to open and you need special technique to open the door.  During my 4 days stay, seem like every time I need help to open the door. But overall is a fantastic hotel."
373580211,March 2016,4.0,Outstanding,"Very modern & minimalistic interior. However, the room type with the big TV console in front of the bed is very impractical, making the room small, avoid it.

365119584,April 2016,3.0,Mehr Schein als Sein,"Wir waren vor zwei Wochenenden im Armani Hotel in Mailand. Zwar sind wir Erfahrene Mailand-Besucher, jedoch das erste Mal im Armani Hotel gebucht. Und garantiert auch das letzte Mal. Der Empfang unten durch den Portier war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Das Check-In Personal hatte eine √úberheblichkeit und Arroganz an sich, die sich f√ºr ein solches Hotel nicht geb√ºhrt. Absolute Negativpunkte waren die nicht vorgenomme R√ºckmeldung bzgl einer erfolglosen Restaurantreservierung, so dass wir uns ""spontan"" am Samstagabend um einen Tisch bem√ºhen mussten. Gekr√∂nt wurde dieses nur noch durch das Vergessen meines Geburtstages. Da wir seit Jahrzehnten immer √ºber meinen Geburtstag verreist sind spreche ich hier aus Erfahrung: Es ist das erste Mal, dass weder eine Karte noch eine Aufmerksamkeit der des Hotels vorlag. Ein absolutes No-Go f√ºr ein 5 Sterne Hotel. Als ""Icing on the cake"" konnte man dann noch die unversch√§mte Parkgeb√ºhr iHv 65 Euro pro Tag bezeichen... Fazit: Mailand immer wieder gern, aber nicht mehr Armani. Hier gibt es deutlich service-orientiertere 5 Sterne Hotels in unmittelbarer N√§he."

Took a while to figure out even for a tech guy. Everything is very minimalist and drawers and cupboards were well hidden.

Last December I decided to organize for some friends the  2015 Christmas Cocktail there and it really was an amazing and positive experience.The glamorous Armani style permeated everything. The warm welcome, the kindness of the staff, and the quality of the food & beverages ‚Äì this was just few days before the restaurant won its first Michelin star.

315859437,October 2015,4.0,leuk en new york gevoel,"we verblijven momenteel in het Armani hotel die we geboekt hebben op aanraden van vrienden. Bij onze aankomst was het eventjes verwarrend daar de receptie zich helemaal op de bovenste verdieping bevindt wat wij niet gewoon zijn. Het is dezelfde verdieping als de loungebar en restaurant. Hostess zeer vriendelijk , bar personeel zeer vriendelijk. We hebben de kleinste kamer geboekt daar de prijs toch vrij duur is. Heel leuke ronde entre vd slaapkamer, badkamer groot genoeg, dressing room gaat ook wel maar de kamer met het bed is toch iets te klein en dit komt door de console die midden in de kamer staat waar tv uit tevoorschijn komt. Pal achter de console staat een bureau die de doorgang moeilijk maakt. De bar bestaat enkel uit gratis water en frisdrank, er is dus geen alcohol beschikbaar wat ik toch wel mis. Met de Ipad wordt alles automatisch bediend, geen probleem voor moderne mensen maar voor iemand zoals mijn moeder die absoluut niks kent van technologie,  zou dit een ramp zijn. Ontbijt is ok maar ook duur: 35 euro/persoon , enkel lekkere confituur heb ik gemist en boter moet je vragen want nergens te zien.De loungebar is prachtig, de natuursteen die ze voor de bar en de vloer gebruiken is zeer mooi. De muziek geeft een gezellige jazz lounge sfeer wat al deze punten mij het gevoel geeft van in New York te zijn. De coupes champagne zijn zeer duur! Het eten is zeer lekker, verschillende gerechten geproefd en niks op aan te merken. De service voor de drank mag misschien wel sneller. Ligging is top. De spa hebben we niet geprobeerd."
315254602,September 2015,5.0,Best in Milano,"The Hotel is all about luxury and design, on the other hands you are in the Giorgio Armani Casa. I love the rooms and its design despite colors are not bright, but the biggest surprise was the service and the SPA at the top not easy to find an hotel in a city with wellness with a view. All in all a great stay enjoying the fashion capitalWill be back"
315205913,September 2015,5.0,"Lugar fabuloso, con personal altamente capacitado,servicio de primera!!","El Hotel esta localizado en la zona de compras ( milano shopping quartiere), caminando Duomo,La Scala,etc... Los cuartos amplios, con decoraci√≥n muy moderna-elegante, el ba√±o muy grande. Los cuartos estan apartar del 7o. Piso por lo que no hay ruido. El bar de mucho ambiente y una carta en el restaurante excelente opci√≥n."
315155821,September 2015,4.0,Pretty great hotel by the heart of the city,"I stayed in Milan for 2 nights before moving on to Zermatt and all hotels but Armani were booked since we arrived at the start of Fashion Week. Staff were pretty nice but the service was pretty slow to be honest. Breakfast was pretty good and had a pretty good variety of food. The features in the room were the highlight. There's a (sort of) hidden mini bar behind a wall and the snacks and drinks were free. There's also an iPad which you can control the room with (see who's at the door since there's a camera by the door, control the lights, control the TV, using the Internet on the TV and controlling it with the ipad). The rate was pretty expensive but it was our only choice. I would stay there again if it was an only choice."
313213339,September 2015,5.0,Bestes Hotel in Mailand!,"Das Armani Hotel ist definitiv das beste Hotel der Stadt.Service, Zimmer, Spa, Aussicht, Lage, Preis/Leistungsverh√§ltnis - einfach alles stimmt. Das ganze Hotel ist top durchgestylt und unverwechselbar Armani. Definitiv eine Reise Wert!"
311614963,June 2015,5.0,Perfection!,"As many noted, this hotel is an experience.  We only stayed there one night, but it was a terrific experience.  The room is minimal and gorgeous.  We asked for a room in front of the San Francesco Church and they accommodated our request.  The food and drinks were fantastic, as was the gym and breakfast.  Truly a five star hotel."
310724716,September 2015,5.0,Fabulous place and even more fabulous staff!,"The Armani Hotel is such a treat in Milan- everything from the modern look and feel, to the food and the location.  What was even better was the staff there- they are wonderful!  Everyone went out of their way to make our stay more pleasant, especially Simona Cusenza!  If you want a truly special experience in Milan we highly recommend the Armani!"
310135846,September 2015,4.0,"Elegant,tr√®s bien situ√©,cher","La situation de l'h√¥tel est excellente,et j'ai trouv√© la d√©co √©l√©gante(mais il est vrai que les chambres sont assez sombres).La vue depuis le lobby et le restaurant,sur les toits de la ville,est tr√®s belle.Dans l'ensemble le personnel est aimable et professionnel et les petits probl√®mes sont r√©gl√©s avec tact et professionnalisme.Un seul point m'a r√©ellement d√©rang√©: la pollution lumineuse dans la chambre;en effet toutes les commandes (lumi√®res,stores)sont violemment r√©tro-√©clair√©s avec des leds puissants,et il est donc impossible d'obtenir la nuit noire dans la chambre,ce qui m'a valu un r√©veil √† 4h50 la premi√®re nuit.La deuxi√®me nuit j'ai soigneusement plac√© des coussins aux (nombreux )endroits strat√©giques pour masquer ces sources lumineuses g√™nantes.C'est clairement une erreur de conception.A part cela ,bel h√¥tel mais trop cher."
309752476,June 2015,5.0,5 Stars to the core!,"A very different kind of 5 stars hotel, completely comfortable and luxurious. The rooms have a modern design with a small TV room, and are loaded with technology. My new favourite hotel in Milan.Wouldn't recommend the restaurants though, as there are plenty of better choices in the neighbourhood."
309682466,August 2015,5.0,Top notch service,"Very impressive stay at a beautiful hotel in the heart of Milan's shopping district.  You can  look at all of the photos to see the hotel is quite beautiful.  In all honesty, the Armani furniture design is not my favourite, but I can appreciate it.What this hotel is AWESOME for is the check-in and concierge staff.  They were incredibly helpful day after day.  From helping my friend call the apple store, to installing my SIM card, to helping us plan all aspects of our trip (tourist visits, Milan expo, small local restaurants), etc. - they were SO helpful.  And I didn't feel like I was getting ""canned"" concierge answers, their advise felt very local and real.  I would the Armani hotel would have pretentious staff, but this is not the case.  We interacted with 5 different staff members and they were all humble, friendly and very hard working.Highly recommend!"
308784756,September 2015,5.0,afbud blev til stor nydelse,"Nobu- den japanske restaurant i stueetagen p√• Armani bygningen blev skiftet ud med en super duper dinner i verdensklasse .

308087657,July 2015,5.0,Designhotel an Toplage,"Wir besuchten das Armani im Zuge der Expo2015. Das Hotel liegt in unmittelbarer N√§he zur Ubahnstation und zum Dom und ist in 10min bequem vom Bahnhof Centrale aus erreichbar. Das Servicepersonal ist √§usserts zuvorkommend und freundlich. Wir haben einen Deluxe Room bewohnt. Das Zimmer ist sehr grossz√ºgig und verf√ºgt ausserdem √ºber einen Entr√©e-Bereich und eine Ankleide in der Verbindung vom Zimmer zum Bad. Das Badezimmer ist riesig. Das Zimmer ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und √ºberzeugt durch die Verwendung hochwertiger Materialien. Die Aussicht vom Fr√ºhst√ºcksraum √ºber die Stadt ist einmalig, das Buffet zudem sehr reichhaltig. Es k√∂nnen warme, sehr sorgf√§ltig angerichtete Mahlzeiten aus der K√ºche √† la carte bestellt werden. Wir wurden am zweiten Morgen durch Bauarbeiten im Hotelkorridor etwas unsanft aus dem Schlaf gerissen. Die Hotelmanagerin hat sich unserer Beschwerde sofort angenommen, sich entschuldigt und ausserordentlich professionell reagiert. Das Hotel kann ich w√§rmstens empfehlen, es ist ein wirkliches Juwel in Mailand."
306876810,June 2015,5.0,Not so shabby very chic,"First visit to Milan we chose the Armani hotel as we thought it would be synonymous with style and quality as the brand is recognised for. The hotel was first rate with great service and in a central position for theatres , shopping and culture. The Armani products provided during our stay were sublime and I wish I could buy the room spray , and candles to evoke the heady Armani Privee aroma at home. The style and elegance of the hotel was supported by the friendly ease of the staff always helpful and happy to oblige without any aloof attitude often experienced in high end boutique environments we recommend this hotel as great value although our room was a little small ."

294416083,July 2015,5.0,Wonderful Hotel and location,"We had the opportunity to stay at the beautiful and stylish Armani Hotel during a recent visit to Milan.  I cannot say enough good things about the hotel.From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by an efficient and friendly staff.  A particular mention goes to Kledis, who made sure we were able to check in right away, even though we were a little early.  He even offered us an upgrade in room to accommodate instant check in, and personally walked us to our hotel room, explaining the design and decor along the way.  He spent at least 15 minutes going over the room, which was very sleek and modern, and chatting about the area and where evrything was located in relation to the hotel..The room was spacious, with every updated amenity you could ask for, including a free mini bar, free espresso machine,huge bathroom, small balcony and ipad with cool electronic controls for everything.  Wifi was included with the hotel stay.The location is perfect, directly situated in the most upscale area, with wonderful, high end shopping and great cafes, restaurants and boutiques all at your door step.  la Scala and the Duomo were only minutes away.We had a drink at the beautiful lounge before dinner (which was recommended by the hotel and also wonderful) which although pricey included little ""treats"" by the chef and other snacks accompanying the drinks.All in all a great hotel and would definitely be back.  Thanks Armani !!!"
294375598,July 2015,4.0,Elegance and charm,"This hotel may have been geared to serve the business traveler, however people seeking an elegant good quality and value, should try this hotel . I will start with the pluses- Location , near every thing yet away a 5 minute walk to all attractions- Rooms- Staff and service - Gym and Spa - rare in Milan hotels- Internet- Food The Armani Milan had a very good butler/Concierge service in general, may have lackeddepth of knowledge at times depending on the individual, but to be fair they tried thier best . If you ladies want shopping this is the place for you, its at the beggining of most high end street in Milan , you can't go wrong , bus and  Metro are 10 meters away as well .The only thing I could think of as a negative or missing is lack of in house attractions or outlets that may keep one in the hotel , like one restaurant one Bar etc..

Service ist toll und das typische, k√ºhle  Armani Design passt f√ºr mich wunderbar in das Umfeld in Mailand - mal was anderes als die auch sehr sch√∂nen alten Palazzi"
286614812,July 2015,5.0,Milanese Jewel,"The Armani Hotel in Milan is a gem of a hotel situated perfectly in the city renowned for its shopping. It is just a few steps away from Via Montenapoleone, the high end luxury brand street and about five minutes walk from the famed Galleria Vittorio Emmanuelle. A metro stop lies next door and provides access to just about everywhere else in the city.  Entry is through a perfunctory albeit luxuriously appointed Ground Floor reception where lifts whisk you up to the seventh floor Lobby for check-in. The staff are warm and welcoming, professional in couture Armani. The hotel radiates sophistication and Milanese chic, with padded walls and metallic finishes. We stayed in a Premiere room which is cocooned in signature Armani tones of grey, brown and black. The 55 sqm room is divided into a bedroom with study desk and sitting area, a large walk-in robe with a bar area just outside and the sumptuous ensuite with separate bath and shower. Armani amenities are generous and replenished daily. The minibar is complimentary and stocks a varied supply of non-alcoholic soft drinks. Snacks are provided as well. The hotel has a sophisticated Restaurant and a more casual Cafe for meals. The Restaurant is particularly impressive, both in the menu and overall ambience.Separate to the hotel‚Äôs dining establishments but within the same building is the Armani Nobu Restaurant. Dining there was a highlight of our stay. The food ( Japanese with South American influences) was great and the atmosphere lively with a sophisticated bar area catering for cocktails.Service throughout our stay was courteous, professional and prompt. While on the more expensive side, we felt the price was fair. There was so much provided for what we paid. Even the in-room dining that we ordered came with a huge complimentary basket of bread. Highly recommended if you are looking for a great experience in Milan."
285886883,July 2015,5.0,Great hotel!,"We stayed at the Armani for just one night but it was fantastic. We were upgraded to a suite - the room was spacious and beautiful, very modern. No balcony or view in our room. The gym is fantastic and the staff/service were great. The location was excellent and I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
285729451,July 2015,4.0,"very nice design, great brand lovely location beware of service and review your bills!",Most staff are really nice and friendly but not providing the best service. I'm a hotelier so I spotted and anticipated the mistakes before they happen. Such as I requested 2 hrs check out late ie 1400 they said max 1330 and starting 1300 different people calling you to push you out. My breakfast was inclusive yet I was asked to sign and of course I know it will create issues and yes it was in my final bill double charge so please check your invoices!
285663584,June 2015,4.0,Just how I imagined an Armani hotel would be.,"Great location, well equipped rooms, reasonable service.The room is an Armani room, so the round vestibule that's seems a waste of space is instead kind of cool. Hard to find a plug to iron a shirt, but that's being very picky.Would I stay here again - maybe not I have done it now, it's not my style, I am obviously not cool enough. Would I recommend it - absolutely, it's a unique hotel and no major issues.Most staff were great, some minor issues getting a seat for a pre dinner drink in the nearly empty bar as the seats were all reserved, sat down at 6 and left at 8 at it was still nearly empty."
284823744,July 2015,5.0,Very Modern Minimalist and perfect Location,"Hotel is very modern and high tech and situated in the heart of Best Milan spots. Near the shopping district of napoleone and 5 minutes walking distance to Duomo.. The amenities are very good, the room is so hightech, you can control everything from the ipad. From TV to AC to alarm clock, everything can be done there. Breakfast is very good too."

The rooms and the hotel areas all very clean, the design was superb and the staff really helpful and enjoyable willing to help us with whatever!!Thank you all so much!Highly Recommended!"
283456984,July 2014,3.0,Way less than expected !!,"It was our honeymoon .. The front desk were impolite and not friendly at all .. Comparing with the one in Dubai , this is way way way behind ..  This does not mean it's a 4 star hotel but talking about ARMANI and a price around +900$ per night.. By paying this bunch of money there are many other options way better than Armani .. I was expected to see something like or at least close to the extraordinary Armani hotel in Dubai .. But unfortunately this was not the reality."
282447801,June 2015,4.0,Beauty beyond skin deep,"The Armani is ideally located within Milan's premier shopping district, ""the rectangle of gold"" and near the bars and restaurants of the Brera - perfect for a weekend getaway. The hotel itself is modern and beautiful, inside and out - and it offers more than aesthetics. The staff are amazing and everything works effortlessly. We arrived early from HK and were allowed to use a spare room to shower and change. When we arrived back to the hotel after lunch, our room and bags were awaiting. Last minute dinner recommendations and reservations were also effortless. The room itself was also a masterpiece of functional design. Everything could be controlled via iPad and everything just worked. The Armani is beauty more than skin deep."
282105254,May 2015,5.0,Great,"Yes, it is great!! From amazing concierge service that takes  care of everything in a prompt and elegant manner to beautiful room amenities!! Beautiful shower and the pillows are the best so far , soft enough and light enough !! We had a room with terrace and we had our lovely tea cakes overlooking at beautiful Duomo !Is not the typical Milanese hotel, is very international , and friendly yet formal type of service , anticipating every need.For Europe is a gem !They also have Nobu there ,!"
281938070,June 2015,5.0,Very Modern and Minimalist!,"I didnt stay at the hotel, but I had the pleasure to know Armani Bamboo Bar. The building is fantastic, very modern and luxuous. From Bamboo Bar you have an amazing view of Milano. I have drinked the best apperitiv of my life! Can't remember the name but it's with blueberries and all of the drinks seemed very good to me. The food was also very nice: I ordered a dish with aspargus foam and black truffles. It was very exotic, but I really enjoyed it because it was light and healthy. It came with a fried egg also, but not fried inside! Just very amazing and sofisticated... Enjoy!"
281071036,June 2015,5.0,A fashionable hotel in the city of Fashion,Armani Hotel is the best hotel to stay in Milan - the city of fashion. The location is just in the middle of the city centre next to boutiques with the most famous brands. Its is just 2 minutes walk to the Chanel shop where I bought my shoes.

Myself and my partner had a wonderful Spa Treatment...WOW the view from the SPA is something I will never forget!!

270989093,May 2015,4.0,Armani Milano: Luxury Experience,"Our stay was nice, I have to say its one of the most chic hotels I ever stayed. Loved the interior d√©cor. The rooms are gorgeous and comfortable. All the staff at the Armani Hotel Milano made us feel more than welcomed. Most of the hotel customers are Italian, you wont see a lot of international guests. We did have a few incidents. We booked this hotel through Tablet Hotels and as ""plus members"" we get some extra perks upon arrival. The hotel was not aware of our booking status and we had to ask for what we were promised later after check-in. I don't think the hotel had proper communication with our booking agent so it felt like we were begging for extra amenities; kind of embarrassing. We should have not been dealing with that. But in the end our booking agent took care of things... The one thing it was quite bothersome was that the housekeeping, night service, bar service kept ringing on our door, a hotel of this caliber should know when the guests are out and then send their staff to complete their duties.. in one night we were bothered about 5 times. It became quite annoying. Things to know about Armani Hotel:* Great amenities, the SPA was wonderful we had a couple's massage and it was amazing... The checking process at the SPA was truly amazing. The gym is beautiful with great city views as well as the ultra-chic pool/Jacuzzi area. * The rooms are amazing, we had a beautiful room and it was very comfortable.* The Armani Bamboo Lounge was a bit disappointing, the food was not good, it was tasteless and very expensive. Service was good though.. I recommend the cocktails, if you are there, have the Juniper Gin Smokey-Martini... its superb!Overall Armani Hotel Milano is great luxury experience!"
270709117,May 2015,5.0,Wonderful Hotel,"Best Hotel we visited in Milan. The service is impeccable and the furniture and interior design first class.

Famous for fashion and design, Milan is a shopaholic's dream. The hotel, with its very nice cafe and the Armani boutique is must. Upon what the so-called 'Quadrilatero d'Oro' ('golden quadrilateral'), is the place to come for designer shopping. The area is bordered by Via Montenapoleone, Via Sant' Andrea, Via Borgospesso and Via della Spiga. Staff is nice, breakfast perfect. coffee is excellent."
265938950,April 2015,5.0,WoW Factor,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with my wife and 2 boys aged, 6 and 2. From the moment we got out of the taxi we were  attended to. We arrived  few hours earlier than expected however we were given complimentary drinks. The Manager Francesco personally looked after us and made sure we had everything we needed. The staff as you would expect looked amazing and always had a smile, even when my 2 boys created a commotion.  The room was extremely spacious with 2 extra beds provided for the boys. If you like technology then you will love this hotel as everything is controlled via the i-pad provided, and extremely easy to use. This includes opening of the curtains to ordering room service. The bathroom was huge and extremely spacious. The power shower is something to experience!!. We did eat in one evening and the food was simply amazing.The Nespresso coffee machine did come in extremely handy and so did the free mini bar topped up on a daily basis with soft drinks. Unfortunately we did not get the opportunity to use the spa however i did go have a look. Definitely a must for next stay. Overall a great hotel and a great experience with amazing attentive staff and located within walking distance to all the designer shops and restaurants. A must stay!!"

Location spaventosamente bella..."
264520139,May 2014,4.0,Excellent hotel - but expensive,"As a hotel this is a truly excellent experience. The rooms are large and well appointed. The Nespresso machine and free soft drinks in the mini bar are a great touch. The bathroom is huge and the bed incredibly comfortable. More of a suite than a room.The hotel does have a spa, although I cannot comment on this as I never managed to visit.The bar is well stocked, and they will prepare a great range of cocktails - if that is what you are looking for. However, the price is steep. A small bottle of beer was 12 Euros. It seems to be the sort of place that people go to see and be seen at, to take someone they want to impress.The restaurant is small, and the food, whilst good quality, is expensive.A cold breakfast is 30 euros (cereal, fruit and pastries). Anything cooked came in at 40 Euros - heavily overprices for what you get. I ordered poached egg on toast. What came out was a poached egg, perfectly presented and uniform in shape. I wondered where the toast was, until i realised - it had been cut to the exact size and shape of the egg. Top marks for artistic interpretation, lost marks for satisfying hunger.The staff could not be faulted, friendly and attentive. Nothing was too much trouble. Certainly a hotel to experience, but at a price."

253509551,January 2015,4.0,Lovely if you like stark Italian modern decor.,"The Armani Hotel in Milan is a top notch establishment, with great service and ambiance....if you like a super cool stark modern environment,  I tend to go for old world hotels when in Europe but decided to give the Armani a try due to a great rate we were able to get for the weekend. The hotel is beautiful, and the staff is excellent.  The decor is very stark and dark, and the hallways were way too dark for my liking.  The bathroom is beautifully done and overall the room was very comfortable.  The drain in the bathroom sink wasn't working but I'm sure if I called someone it would have been fixed promptly (didn't bother).  The spa area however was a bit of a disappointment  The hot tub was luke warm at best and we were told that's the way it has to be, so it wasn't even worth going into.  And the relaxation area, which has a beautiful view of the city in daytime, doesn't allow mobile phones, yet everyone was chatting away on theirs making the environment less than relaxing.  I left and complained and the staff was truly very sorry this happened but they should been monitoring it to start with.  We didn't eat in the restaurant there or frequent the bar but I'm sure it was lovely, as it too has a wonderful view of the rooftops of the city.  The room is 100% digital which was interesting.  The TV even drops down into the dresser it's sitting on when you turn it off.  It was a very nice stay and again, recommend it if high tech sleek modern design is your thing.  It's also in a great location with close access to everything you'd want to see or do in Milan."

242335851,December 2014,3.0,Armani Hotel Milano em Mil√£o,"Na minha opini√£o o hotel est√° em uma categoria a parte, definiria como um hotel design, longe de um verdadeiro cinco estrelas, eu gostei muito do hotel, por√©m tenho explicar o que falei √© porque falei anteriormente:1- a portaria √© ruim, n√£o tem ba√≠a de desembarque do t√°xi ou carro, s√≥ ficam dois funcion√°rios que s√£o muito descontra√≠dos e normalmente chegam atrasados...para abrir porta ...auxiliar em t√°xis...em fim a entrada √© ruim. O lobby fica no s√©timo andar , tem uma funcion√°ria que fala portugu√™s o que √© muito bom para n√≥s brasileiros ajuda muito, ela √© extremamente simp√°tica e ajuda muito na chegada ao hotel. Ainda falando da chegada o lobby se confunde com a entrada do restaurante.2- o quarto √© maravilhoso , mito bom mesmo...mas o sistema de automa√ß√£o √© antiquado, deveria ser moderno..essa seria a ideia , mas os controles de luz n√£o apagam a luz, mesmo com tudo apagado, isso n√£o me atrapalhou dormir mas minha esposa sentiu dificuldades...√† televis√£o √© p√©ssima tem poucos canais com muita coisa s√≥ acess√≠vel paga. Tem muita TV do oriente m√©dio, acho que querem fazer o tipo...somos frequentados por cheiques √°rabes...e tal...e vc esta aqui.. Aproveite sua estadia !!!3- o caf√© √© pago, 33 euros por pessoa o bufet mais o caf√© ou seja cuidado com o que pede...Rs , mas apesar de pago, √© maravilhoso !!!! Muito bom !!!!4- localiza√ß√£o maravilhosa melhor dif√≠cil, d√° para ir andando a tudo.Depois de tudo que falei, pode parecer que n√£o gostei ...mas adorei...gostei muito...gostei muito mesmo...mas n√£o volto, mas j√° fui Rs...agora falando s√©rio ..o hotel apesar de bom careceria de melhorar em muito sua administra√ß√£o e alguns conceitos pois pelo pre√ßo que cobra teria de ser um pouco melhor, at√© para preservar o nome da marca."

La camera pulitissima, ordinata e devo dire con ogni comfort...ho avuto la fortuna di gustare anche il loro fornitissimo Brunch domenica a pranzo...fornitissimo, con diverse prelibatezze...l'unica nota stonata, e ribadisco l'unica: durante il brunch eravamo in 4 a mangiare, ci sono stai serviti due assaggi di primo, un raviolo e risotto alla milanese...e sopra ci sono stati grattati in tutto 7 grammi di tartufo bianco, ribadisco in tutto...cio√® per tutte e 4 le persone 7 grammi. Beh alla fine nel conto mi sono ritrovato un extra di 112,00‚Ç¨ per 7 grammi di tartufo...oltre al fatto che mi sembra un prezzo un po' eccessivo sarebbe stato pi√π corretto prima del servizio segnalare che l'aggiunta di tartufo comportava un extra.

233059195,October 2014,3.0,Experience do not commensurate with the price you pay,"Somehow, I always seem disappointed with the hotels I choose in Milano. A lot of hotels offer more hype, rather than substance. I stayed for 2 nights in an Armani Classic Suite which costed me about 750 Euros per night (breakfast included). This was already apparently a bargain as the rate quoted on the Internet was nearly 900 Euros per night. With such a high price tag, you can understand why my expectations were high. The hotel is located at an ideal spot, opposite the fashionable Via Montenapoleone, next to a Metro Station, so transport is not an issue. Check in was efficient enough, though the reception staff were ""cold"". However, you could overlook that simply because ""its an Armani hotel!"". The room itself was modern - you could control almost everything by a remote device. However, there are signs of wear and tear. The hotel is about 3 years old now. Housekeeping was generally prompt and well done. The concierge / doormen were however excellent. Breakfast was rather good for Italian standards. For dinner, I ate at the adjacent Norbu Japanese restaurant, which was great, though expensive by Milano standards. All in all, the experience was somewhat underwhelming probably because my expectations were higher than usual. I'm not sure I'd stay here again, given the fact that there are now many more competitively priced 4 to 5 star hotels in Milano."
233048252,October 2014,5.0,Great Location and Excellent Hospitality!!,"Due to some urgent Business needs I happened to stay in the hotel with my team, and we were pleasantly surprised by the excellent service and the treatment  extended by the Hotel team during our stay. Talk about In room Dining or Restaurant, you want something, even if it is not there in the Menu, they never say no. They try to make sure, they get it tailor-made for you. Location was a hit all the way for me. Beautiful churches, historical places such as Forts are at walkable distances. So when you get time off from work you can get yourself rejuvenated by spending time there. To sum up, I would love to come back and be treated with the great hospitality the hotel provides."

232294376,September 2014,5.0,What a gem of design and taste,"Once you get at the door and you look around, certainly understand what simplicity and luxury!Everything you see is understated and of an extreme class. The lobby is on the 7 floor with an amazing view over the centre of the CityDeluxe room are small but very high tech and super clean, flat wall corridors and dimmed lightingRestaurant is to die for as well as the cocktails at the very busy barCant fault it real luxury"
232097991,September 2014,4.0,Very good and decent hotel but not the best,"To start, the hotel is very modern very well located near montenapoleone.  The room is decent and very high tech.  Free minibar no good selection of nespresso?I love the bathroom and definitely I love the towels.The bed is comfortable but the pillow is so soft and you can't feel Anything..The room is too dark and once you forgot to charge the remote control, you doomed. Everything is controll by the remote, from tv, lightning, drapes, etc.. So make sure you charge it before you sleep."
231647645,September 2014,5.0,Best in Milan,"Trendy Trendy Trendy! Best place we have visited whilst in Milan.Following Via Monte Napoleone you will end up in this amazing sort of Edwardian building with Armani logos everywhere at the basement.On the 7floor the best Bar with a view in Milan,  great ambience and cocktails. Yes expensive , but worth it"

229658221,September 2014,5.0,Can't wait to go back !!!,"Whatever I say or write about this hotel won't be enough !So I will simply say : everything was perfect !!!! Perfect ! One comment though : the music in the corridor of the rooms could be heard until the room , since I have a very light sleep , it woke me up :(((( as for the rest, it was luxury by excellence ! Service , breakfast , rooms , interior, room utilities : NO COMMENT !!!! You get what you pay at the end !"

228505394,September 2014,4.0,Enjoyed the 'Armani' experience,"My family and I had a lovely stay at the Armani hotel recently. We enjoyed the ambience and overall signature 'Armani' look of the hotel. It was quite different to our usual flashy and grand hotel bookings. The hotel however was definately not suited for young children. There was no pool only an indoor jacuzzi area. This area was not child friendly at all. The gym was spectacular as per my husbands high standards. He enjoyed the technogym equipment. The rooms were lovely, spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was beautiful and the shower was perfect. The Armani signature products were the best I have used. The soap was rich and creamy and smelled exotic. The breakfast was delicious however the room service  was average. The chef did an amazing baby puree for my 10 month old daughter who savoured and enjoyed the different taste. My daughter celebrated her birthday during our stay and the hotel surprised her with a delicious cake. The children did enjoy the free mini bar and loved the opportunity to try the local drinks. The hotel is in the perfect location close to many of the cities sights and shopping areas. We had a lovely stay."
228415537,September 2014,5.0,Luxe et calme,"H√¥tel √† la d√©coration minimaliste et classe. Subtile parfum diffus√© comme c'est agr√©able!!

Seuls petits points n√©gatifs, manque de luminosit√© car donnant sur une cour int√©rieure et les commandes murales de domotique emettent une lumi√®re qui √©claire trop la chambre durant la nuit, dommage. Avons mang√© au ristorante Armani (poisson excellent et dessert Sph√®re chocolat divin). Tr√®s belle exp√©rience."
227518617,July 2014,5.0,Second time there. We keep liking it a lot!,"Superb location, very good room service, nice and delicious breakfast (but the service wasn't at its best), One of the rooms we were using had a humidity smell at its entrance. Don't know why.They still has some issues with the hair dryers that have the power cord attached to the drawer and they turn off after some minutes of use. That's harsh for the ladies with long hairs!!"
227386346,September 2014,5.0,Impeccable service.,"My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary. The rooms are neat and interestingly automated. The design of the hotel is also very interesting, and the motif of the D'Uomo of Milan is found throughout the hotel. What lifts this hotel from just a 'very good' hotel, to an extraordinary hotel, is the service. Right from the staff at the lobby, to those at the bar and restaurant, everyone goes out of their way to make you feel special. The Bar has some really interesting cocktails which I've had nowhere else (cocktails with salmon, for instance!).The restaurant is superb. I would recommend the Piccolo Degustazione which is the small tasting menu."
227173437,September 2014,5.0,Style and Luxury,"THE  Hotel in Milan! We were there for our Anniversary and couldn't be a better choice. We did visit few Hotels in Italy but this is without a doubt the most stylish Hotel of them all.From the start we felt at home, very friendly and attentive personnel, clean rooms and good food, the Bamboo Bar is amazing , good music and great vibe.Rooms are good size and amazing gadget, pillows to die for, Well done Mr Armani!Will be back"
226502994,March 2014,5.0,Designer Hotel does not disappoint,"Where do you start with a hotel that got everything right?  The espresso machine in each room or the monogramed china to drink it in?  Or maybe the amenities which include shortie robes, slippers, Armani soaps & lotions, manicure kit or maybe the Armani lotion?  Don't get me started on the bed!  Luxurious linens and pillows to die for!  You would missing out if you did not visit the restaurant.  Top notch service and Italian food that has just the right amount of Haute attitude for Armani!!  Did I mention the doors don't have knobs? The design of the common spaces is very  sleek, modern and intriguing."
225821014,April 2014,5.0,amazing,Shopping in Milan and What a place to stay !From the very first moment that you enter this hotel you feel that this is Armani. the bar the service the luxury one perfect match. A world of sophisticated beauty ?
225392749,August 2014,5.0,‚ÄúClassy like the Armani Dubai,"We booked this Hotel with high expectations after staying at the Dubai one.Surprisingly was even better, a real Italian flair in a stylish quarter, the location is just perfect, metres away from Monte Napoleone and La Scala.Great food and service with many young smiling faces, never intrusive always helpful.Armani SPA on the top floor is amazing , fantastic views and relaxation areas with pool.This Hotel is without a doubt the best Hotel in Milan, don‚Äôt look for old boring Hotels,a perfect choice for a short break in the fashion capital.My wife simply loved it, cannot go anywhere else now."
225286364,August 2014,5.0,4 shades of grey,"Central location, most elegant hotel is what one expects from Armani in Milan.  Stunning modern rooms.  It took a little time to work out how to operate all the switches.  Amazing breakfast, great bar, good concierge services.  Personal and prompt service."
220566719,August 2014,4.0,Excellent,"Modern, comfortable, super designed if you are into that, but then again, it's Armani, so I expect no less.  The staff is lovely, polite and attentive.  Stayed in a very spacious suite with great bathroom and a TV that appears from the console.  Everything in the room is automated.  Bose speakers are outdated, as they still have the big pin connector for the old iphones, updating and/or adding audio cable would be really nice (myself being android, my husband iphone 5).Could do without the incense smell that penetrates the entire hotel, closets and bathroom soaps."
219937214,July 2014,5.0,Luxury,"Modern spacious and very comfortable. Automated curtains and lights. I love the scent in the hotel. As one enters the hotel the smell is most enticing and welcoming. Staff, very professional, kind and always helpful. Position of the hotel is perfect. My favorite hotel when I am in Milano"
219400434,April 2014,3.0,Disappointed... Too designed.,"Having been to the bar a few times, I decided to try this hotel. The rooms were too dark and completely over designed. I even had a hard time getting out of the common bathroom near the reception because I couldn't figure out how the handle works. Bathrooms were really generous, but overall it didn't make up for the disappointing and aging rooms. In a hotel that super designed, the rooms can get worn out and outdated very quickly. Service was not that great either... It was the Milan Marathon on the day of my departure. The receptionist knew we were leaving, but did not let us know in advance. In the end, we missed our flight because we spent 3 hours driving in circles trying to leave the city center. Overall a disappointing stay even though I did see Giorgio walking the property during my stay."
217502602,July 2014,5.0,MA-RA-VI-LHO-SO,"O hotel √© maravilhoso, muito moderno, bem decorado e sofisticado. O atendimento foi excelente e todos os funcion√°rios, sem exce√ß√£o, s√£o super sol√≠citos, s√≥ falta te carregar no colo. Os quartos s√£o muito bonitos e bem decorados, tem m√°quina de caf√© expresso e o frigobar est√° incluso na di√°ria. O caf√© da manh√£ √© muito bem servido, tem v√°rias frutas, cereais, p√£es e a apresenta√ß√£o.. acho que nunca v√≠ nada igual. O SPA do hotel tamb√©m √© excelente, tem sauna √∫mida e seca, sala para banho turco e uma piscina muito bacana. O hotel fica localizado em uma √°rea muito nobre, onde tem as melhores lojas e no pr√©dio do pr√≥prio hotel tem caf√©, restaurante, loja... Vale muito a pena ficar l√°!"
216766294,July 2014,4.0,"Molto Armani ma con due ""mahhh"" ......","La posizione non potrebbe essere migliore; a fianco della metropolitana e a due passi da tutti i pi√π grandi nomi di Milano. Esci e sei in Via Manzoni a pochi metri da Via Montenapoleone e Via della Spiga. Da fuori √® imponente, in pratica √® un isolato dove tutto √® Armani. E l‚Äôingresso √® molto Armani. Sali al settimo piano nella lobby per il check-in dove tutto √® molto minimal, molto Armani. Poi scendi (nel senso letterale del termine) nelle camere. Io avevo la 406. La camera √® molto bella, estremamente tecnologica, un bagno grandissimo ma .. con due mahhh‚Ä¶.. Il primo ‚Äúmah‚Äù √® stato ‚Äúcome mai a tratti e in certi luoghi della camera c‚Äô√® odore di chiuso, di umido, quasi di muffa?‚Äù. Esistono delle note di incenso di sottofondo che danno un senso di rilassamento, ma a tratti veniva fuori questo odore. Odore che poi diveniva intensissimo quando aprivi gli armadi. Questo odore capita di sentirlo in quelle case di campagna quando non vai mai‚Ä¶. Ma perch√© sentirlo in un albergo come questo?? Appena ho riportato questo problema, immediatamente hanno provveduto a profumare l‚Äôambiente, ma a tratti ‚Äì e soprattutto il mattino seguente ‚Äì si sentiva ancora. Il secondo ‚Äúmah‚Äù √® stato di notte. Non riuscivo a dormire, non riuscivamo entrambi a dormire! Le luci dei pannelli di controllo ci ipnotizzavano ed illuminavano in modo eccessivo (gusto nostro personale) la camera. Preciso comunque ‚Äì a scanso di equivoci ‚Äì che sono abituato a dormire in campagna al buio pesto, ma queste camere mi / ci sembravano troppo illuminate. Ho chiamato e  mi hanno mandato dopo circa 10 minuti un signore per mettere delle cartoline sulle fonti luminose. Ho poi saputo che tante persone si lamentavano dell‚Äôassenza di buio.La colazione √® buona ma non eccelsa. E per quello che mangi √® troppo cara!!!  E per certi minuti non vedi l'ombra di un waiter!! La location invece √® fantastica!!! La vera perla dell‚Äôhotel √® la Spa!! √à da provare!! √à un‚Äôesperienza unica!!!"
215861200,July 2014,5.0,Living the Armani lifestyle,"The  Armani hotel is a combination of understated style, elegance and sophistication, being at home away from home.The hotel is located on Via Alessandro Manzoni, 31 which also houses the Armani flagship Megastore and the Emporio Armani Caffe' among other Armani branded stores.The hotel is just a short eight minute stroll to the Duomo the worlds forth largest cathedral completed in the early 1800s, The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II one of the worlds first shopping centres and Sforzesco Castle built in the 15th century.The staff are professional, helpful and most importantly are genuine and are proud to be apart of the hotel, this is by far the best hotel I have stayed at I genuinely didn't want to leave.There is no other alternative in Milan you need to experience this hotel!"

213560768,July 2014,5.0,1 Night Business Trip to Milano,"Perfect location on Via Manzoni, very near to the center of the city. Just above the Armani shop. Reception and restaurant on 7th floor with view over the whole city, as slightly above the other buildings.Rooms very spacious and modern, all in the Armani style.Mini-bar included. WiFi working perfectly for free. Bathroom huge.They even have a pillow menue.I am convinced there is probably no better alternativ in Milano."

213441545,June 2014,5.0,A class act,"Before I describe the hotel, I must mention the staff - they were fantastic - professional, warm, welcoming, helpful in every way. They were also kind to the children which is a huge plus. Compliments to all the team for making us feel so welcome.We had two rooms - one was bigger than the other and more warmly styled. Beautiful wardrobes and both had enormous bathrooms. It is all very neutral in terms of colour scheme and modern, as you would expect from Armani - if you want vibrant personality it won't be the hotel for you. Immaculate housekeeping and great attention to detail - his and hers sized slippers for example, instead of one size fits all; and in attention to detail I have never seen, they even put a bookmark in a book I had open so I would not lose my page. And thanks for the daily weather cards - a lot of hotels don't do this anymore and I really like it! Great jacuzzi and spa area overlooking Milan rooftops. And of course an enormous Armani store is attached to the hotel. Mini bar (non alcoholic) is complimentary which is a nice touch.  We also bought some stuff from the Giorgio Armani store a few blocks away and they were happy to deliver it to the hotel for us.Any suggestions for improvement?- shower smelt a bit musty, hard to ventilate it where it is located, needs something to freshen it up- would be great if we could charge the Armani Cafe (which was very good) to our room- the little panels on the wall that control lights emit a bright white light, hard to get the room totally dark to sleep"
211132559,June 2014,5.0,"Armani a touch of class, as usual.","You can be forgiven to think you are at the wrong place when you walk in from the street, not much to resemble a high class hotel, however once up the lift the doors open into the world of Armani, to your right is a bar/lounge which is very relaxing and a great variety of beverages and snacks. This is a great place to have a meeting as it is quiet but still gives a level of professionalism supported by the great waitering staff. As you make your way into the rooms you struggle to take note of where the doors are, surprise surprise they are there just well blended into the modern colours and walls of the hallway. Once you find the door it leads into a modern luxurious room, well equipped with coffee  machine and a free in room bar. The bathroom is one of the best I have seen in Europe with modern quality fittings and plenty of room. The choice of restraunts is terrific with both Armani Nobu and Armsni restraunt gives the hotel the final touch of perfection. Highly recommended."
210084469,June 2014,5.0,Divine!,"We finished our trip around France and Italy with a stay at Armani and I couldn't think of a better way to top it! From the moment you step off via Manzoni into the hushed and peaceful surrounds, you are taken to another world. Even the coffee bar in the room is a piece of perfection. Rooms are absolutely silent, you feel like no-one else is even in the hotel it's that discrete! Loved it! We even spotted Mr Armani himself wondering around the Brera district only a few minutes from the hotel. Who could ask for more?!"

204743164,October 2013,4.0,Bello ma freddo,Sono un' imprenditrice e vengo a Milano per affari periodicamente. Ho scelto di soggiornare in questo albergo proprio perch√© attirata dalla notoriet√† del brand e dal desiderio di verificare di persona la scelta che il marchio di alta moda ha fatto nell'investire nel turismo. Devo dire che il design e' molto curato  e la pulizia impeccabile ma il personale molto professionale si √® mostrato a tratti troppo freddo e distaccato. Sono comunque felice di aver potuto soggiornare in questo lussuoso albergo che comunque resta un fiore all'occhiello dell'imprenditoria milanese.

200215953,April 2014,5.0,It's Armani,"As I was imagining, such a name of elegance in fashion should have a unique hotel.Yes it is unique.Nice, so helpful staff special thanks to Mr.Emilio at the front desk.Room is like a space ship!  Your journey starts from the elevator through the corridors up to your room, what a smart decorations they have!Location is at the heart of Milan,Definitely if visited Milan again, will stay here."
200186541,April 2014,5.0,"Milano, in a modern way.","Ok, so some of the tech, especially the TV can be annoyingly over-complicated. But the aesthetic of the rooms, the attentiveness of the staff (who were all VERY helpful) and the location make this hotel a perfect Milan home. It is expensive, but so is the quality of the room.Everything had the designer's pov with his quirks. Example, when we arrived, the bed had no sheet, but was covered with a spread, transforming it into a ""sofa"". Turndown was a fresh bed made for you.And while it might not suit everyone, if you want to experience what it feels to live in the world of high-fashion, have a taste of the first modern hotel experience that others have emulated, enjoy the Armani.Avoid eating at the bar, the food was meh, but definitely use the gym. It's a room with a view!"
199349577,March 2014,5.0,Armani - where perfection meets tranquility,"The perfect service starts with a different welcome. No ugly reception desk covered with company signs, brochures and computers. Just a nice guy with a relaxed ""Welcome to Armani Hotels"" asks for your car key and let's you know he will take care of all the rest. The elevator takes you to the lobby on the 7th floor. Again no typical hotel reception. A counter without ANY advertising or visible computer equipment. ""Please just sign here, we are happy to upgrade you to a suite for your birthday booking."" The suite is spacious and a quiet realm in crowded Milano. Is anything missing you would expect in a top class 5* luxury hotel? No. Giorgio Armani designed a very calm place in a mixture of shimmering gray tones. He took his care for details to the extreme - being reduced as much as possible at the same time. All this marketing and advertising stuff which you'll find in today's 5* rooms is absent. This design concept is peace for your information overloaded mind.The service is personal, fast and extremely caring. We had a problem with the dinner at the Armani restaurant (you may want to skip that...) which was nicely solved to our satisfaction.If you want to give yourself a weekend of peace and pleasure you are in the right hotel."

Electric drapes, remote control units for everything conceivable, then you are in heavenThe rooms are beautifully appointed and well laid out. It is not my personal style , but I would stay there again without a doubtThe only irritating thing is the terrible smell of incense as you walk into the hotel.

180251003,July 2013,5.0,Great Experience,"I have stayed in this hotel four or five times over the past year. I travel to Milan frequently for work and enjoyed the stay so much the first time I've decided to continue to stay there each time I visit Milan. The staff is extremely conscientious and professional, the beds are very comfortable, the food is excellent and so is the feel of the entire hotel. However, the very best part is the rooftop spa and workout area. It is simply a special area that is reason alone to go to Milan and stay at the hotel.I highly recommend staying at the hotel on your next visit."
180090068,October 2013,5.0,Superb. Just superb.,"If you read my other reviews, you'll realise I stay at a fair few hotels - and I do expect a lot for my hard earned cash. So when I say the Armani Hotel in Milan is superb, believe me, it really is.It's everything you'd expect from the name Armani: stylish, slick, beautifully tailored, understated. The design is faultless, the staff attend to every detail. We were warmly greeted on arrival, shown to our room, our bags followed. Welcome chocolates, a free (soft drinks) mini bar and snacks left every evening, fresh bottled water left with turn down each night, Armani Privee toiletries replenished daily, soft fluffy towels aplenty, robes and proper slippers, well thought through lighting, plenty of closet space, a very comfortable bed and crisp white bedding...need I go on? Breakfast is a generous buffet (included in our room rate). We were offered additional dishes to order - eggs, pancakes, etc. all included in the rate. The restaurant, like the rest of the hotel, is stylish but comfortable. The bar is also beautiful. And the spa...some of the best treatments I've had anywhere in the world and a stunning view over the rooftops of Milan as you relax afterwards with an iced tea.So can I find any faults t all? I've had to really try to find anything to criticise! The bath let the room down - too small and impossible to properly recline in (but the shower was so good I didn't miss the bath really). And there's no pool, which does seem a bit of an oversight, as there's a jacuzzi the size of a pool!In conclusion, I'd like o give the last thought to the reception / concierge staff. They were so helpful, found us reservations t great restaurants and attractions, and showed such attention to detail. They're the true assets of this hotel. I can't wait to stay again."
179691164,September 2013,5.0,Top Class Staff,"We tried to stay at the Armani but it was fully booked (F1 then Fashion week). However, we went to the cocktail bar in the evening and apart from the prices (which you have to expect) everything was excellent. A very wide range of properly mixed and presented cocktails, knowledgeable staff and a nice atmosphere made for a couple of very enjoyable evenings. Also, the head customer relations manager (apologies for forgetting your name) treated us very well when we wanted a restaurant of which I had forgotten both the name and the address!! He had me describe it then found it on the net. Don't walk past this place!"

Spacious and love the walk in wardrobe, plush linen and towels and attention to details - to the bath cap, the toiletries and the TV which goes down when you turn it off. the lighting system is also very interesting and can be confusing, but was great as you can adjust it to your liking. interiors are very sleek but maybe somewhat too showroom like as everything was like greys and whites and black. so it may not be appealing to some who wants a bit more homey sort of luxury.the fully equiped gym is open 24 hours and they have plenty of water and towels there. there is a beautiful jacuzzi and steam and sauna rooms. nice and warm lounging area with pool decks looking out at the church outside, with complimentary cool drinks served from morning till night. very nice and friendly spa staff to offer suggestions. unfortunately, i did not have enough time to enjoy all of it. location is superb as the armani shop is just below and we were able to grab a pair of jeans within minutes before we headed for the airport. most shopping is done within walking distance to the hotel and is also a short walk to the duomo area."

172860873,July 2013,4.0,Nice Stay - Would Stay Again,"Wasn't sure what to expect for I had read mixed reviews on this hotel. Upon arriving, we were greeted by staff and arrived upstairs at check in where we waited a good 20 minutes to get checked in.  There were only 2 couples in front of us but just one person at the desk.  The second woman at the desk was on the phone the whole time.  We were pleasantly surprised and upgraded to a larger suite.  Halls are very dark but quite quiet which was good.  The room was very spacious and sleek a bit too modern for me but not complaining.  My husband enjoyed the decor.  Challenges with the remote.   Horrid smell from the shower where we called for service and team arrived to resolve.  Unfortunately the following day the smell in the area returned - guessing the plumbing?  Either way, stay was enjoyable, staff was pleasant and we would stay here again."

170497176,August 2013,3.0,just ok,well i have been to the best so i was expecting something to blow my mind.what i found was a sleek modern hotel. While it has everything you needed i found that you had to take one elevator to get to the 7th floor lobby and then another to go down to the rooms.i have never seen this and imho this wasnt for my likes. I also liked the free mini bar touch BUT no booze so that defeated that nice touch. Finally going to bed I cut my toe on a piece of wood sticking up from the wood floor.While there is nothing wrong for 500 euro i expected alot more but the sheets and bed are super comfy.
167835251,June 2013,5.0,Flawless!,"Amazing hotel, sleek modern design, detailed attention!I stayed in a business suite, which was more like an apartment.I fell like in my own place, everything at the tip of your hand, the desk, the complimentary minibar, the coffee... every detail to make you feel welcome.Perfect location, walking distance to where you want to be when in Milan.The staff was beyond any expectation, their dedication turned my stay at this hotel into a truly remarkable experience.The breakfast at the rooftop restaurant was lavish, a generous variety to please any pallet.The swimming pool and spa are of an absolute beauty.So enjoyable, every single minute of your stay!"
167028603,July 2013,4.0,Armani... the Hotel not Giorgio... needs a little polish,"The Hotel lobby, the room and the bathroom, were as chic as a runway original.  However, while the young staff was friendly, and always enthusiastic to help, they just could not deliver like the seasoned pros.  An example; There never seemed to be a dedicated concierge.  Each time I returned to the desk for advice.... a dinner suggestion, perhaps, a different person, sometimes with no real concierge   experience, was available for ""their best try"".  I am sure in time, the polish will shine. With a very good restaurant, beautiful facility, stylish rooms (if your not tech shy), and great location.... it is  well on its way."
166702428,July 2013,5.0,Gorgeous and very modern hotel,"Truly 5 stars all the way. Clean, modern hotel, with lovely room, bedroom somewhat cramped, but bathroom made up for it. Really spacious bathroom. Our room had a private balcony which was nice.Complementary water, complementary mini bar, with nightly selection of chocolates, and WiFi.Excellent service all around. Staff were great!Perfect location, close to the beautiful Duomo and all the major shopping.Nothing negative about this hotel, my kids and I loved it! Will love to go back."
165874017,March 2013,5.0,True luxury,"INTERIOR DESIGNStunning attention to detail.  Beautiful finishings. There is absolutely no clutter including the treatment room, with cosmetics, accessories, towel heaters stuffed away from view. The glass facade gives breathtaking views of churches and red-tile rooftops and on one side - the new skyscrapers of Milan. The huge jacuzzi lets you fully enjoy that and relax from the busy city life. Even the saunas, while keeping your privacy, let you enjoy that wonderful panorama - I truly believe it's one of the most beautiful views of Milan that I ever admired. The leather loungers are heated, so I felt very cosy tucked in the soft bathrobe.CLEANINESSSpotless.SERVICEI loved the service in this 5*+ hotel. It's just enough to look around lost to immediately have a member of the staff personally take you to wherever you wanna go. The therapists were friendly but not over-chatty, on time, addressed you by your name and made sure that you were satisfied all the time. The massage was carried out in a very professional manner, keeping privacy as their main priority. They really made me feel like a celebrity VIP. Great job!FOODThe spa has a large self-service bar area. PRICESAdequate to the luxury of the place. Although it's costly, I would be happy to return and pay the same price for the level of service that I received. LOCATIONThe impressive Armani building is located in the fancy shopping and going out area of Milan. OVERALLIt definitely deserves its stars and is a real luxurious experience. The small details like a vanity set, elegant disposable underwear, the therapists putting a bathrobe around your shoulders - makes a huge difference. I can honestly recommend it to anyone who can afford themselves to go. It's a perfect place to watch the sunset with your loved one. My favourite city resort!"
165370190,June 2013,4.0,Perfect Location for shopping,"Location is Perfect for shopping, bang in the middle of all the shops. Service is standard 5 stars, staffs look immaculate. We booked ourselves into a junior suite. A little smaller than expected. For 2 pple it's alright, it's definitely too small for an extra bed.  Decor is very Armani, amenities are lovely."

Hotel bar and restaurant with great views, good food and perfect service. Spa area as well great with small individual saunas an hammans -fine idea Only 50 Euro for Parking is too $$$. Location as well great for shopping. Coffee Bar on the side on the streat is as well a ""to do"" and drinking the coffee on the bar makes it even ""cheap"" with 1.5 Euro."

Ow, love the scent.."
162604669,May 2013,5.0,Awesome Armani,"Loved it, Great room, on the corner of the building level 3. Fabulously comfortable bed, nice big bathroom (bath is a bit small) but the rest of the bathroom is first class with good water pressure, and outstanding fixtures and fittings. The location of the hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Duomo, lots of restaurants nearby, and of course all of the designer shops are at your doorstep. Its a short nice walk to all of the best parts of Milan. Even basic rooms here are great.The dining room has an underlit floor, designed in a black and white checker board pattern. The white tiles light your face up softly, so everyone looks good ala doris day...love it. The mostly very young staff are well trained, helpful, polite and pleasant to deal with. Yes, you have to enter from the ground floor and go to level 7 to check in. Then go to another set of elevators to get to your room. The staff are very helpful in all of this. I found that this added to privacy and did not cause me any concern at all. Is this child friendly, no, I would not take my children here which suits a lot of people who want an adult experience. As far as being grey and dull, that is absolute rubbish, it is handsome and elegant. Well done Mr Armani."
161170056,September 2012,5.0,Aperitivo con vista,"Cocktails spettacolari, con ingredienti insoliti e fantasticamente abbinati.L'Armani Bamboo/Bar √® da provare anche per godere della splendida vista sui tetti di Milano e rilassarsi mentre l'ultima luce del sole illumina le gigantesche vetrate e viene riflessa sulle pareti retroilluminate.Il prezzo, ovviamente, non √® quello del solito happy-hour, ma ne vale la pena."
161118079,April 2013,5.0,The Pinnacle of a relaxing experience..,"This hotel does not lack anything in the atmosphere ranks. By far one of the most relaxing hotels I've come across, from the decor to the discreet nature of the staff, I really can't fault it.  The spa is located on the op floor, giving somewhat restricted views of the Duomo on a nice day, information mentions a pool, it's not so much a pool as a largish jacuzzi, which is so warm and relaxing...a must try.The only failing, was the in-house bar, where the barman failed to produce a smoothie or a cocktail worth drinking, in fairness he refused to accept payment despite my insistence, excellent customer service considering it was clear that the drinks didn't meet any kind of standard.The location of the hotel is perfect, with the shopping and the Duomo minutes away.  The major winner for this hotel is the attention to detail, I received contact,via telephone call (not E-MAIL) 2 days prior to my arrival, asking if I had any special requests, having stayed in hotels across the globe, this touch put this hotel a cut above the rest.It des not strike me as a child-friendly hotel though, and to be honest, it's probably best left that way."

160445353,April 2013,3.0,Very depressing rooms and not worth the price one pays for it,"This hotel is at the most amazing location right in the main area where all the shopping and other attractions is. The rooms are small i stayed in a suite which is the same size as a normal room in other hotels, but they have great bathroom. The decor is very depressing the corridors are all grey and dark. The service in the hotel are excellent. I would recommend this hotel to people who like to stay in ultra modern properties, for the rest i would recommend to the the Bvlgari or Ritz, as they are same price."
160336939,February 2013,5.0,Fantastico il design,"Hotel Fantastico per il design e l'interior design! Gli ambienti sono super curati, molto belle anche le camere. Se proprio vogliamo trovare una piccola pecca, lo staff √® super impostato (forse come √® giusto che sia) e raffredda un po tutto l'ambiente. Pulizia impeccabile e buona colazione."

In una giornata di primavera, dopo aver girato tra le vie dello shopping milanese sono andata al Lounge Bar dell'hotel Armani. Il personale √® accogliente e premuroso. L'arredamento √® molto semplice, ma di gran classe, con diverse gradazioni di beige e grigi che danno una sensazione di tranquillit√† e di confort.Il servizio √® impeccabile, veloce ed attento. Il  cocktail √® accompagnato da stuzzichini caldi e freddi di buona qualit√†. I prezzi sono nella media della zona e del livello del locale.Consigliato."
157345534,April 2013,5.0,Amazing hotel. ..simply Armani,"Apart from the room being too small( it fell like a bathroom with a bedroom en suite),  this hotel was the best hotel in the world! !!!

157077952,April 2013,5.0,7th Heaven,"Es gibt in Mailand nur ein Hotel. Das Armani. Lage, Blick, Service alles stimmt. Eine Erfahrung die es lohnt zu machen.Sicher nicht das typische 5 Sterne Hotel aber √ºberraschend und unverwechselbar. Der Blick √ºber Mailand ist einzigartig."
155905964,March 2013,4.0,Really worth it!!!,By the time you arrive you experience a great stay.Simple elegant lines by maestro Armani.

There are hundred things to mention regarding the room & bathrooms excellent design.We loved it.
154949620,January 2013,4.0,Sofisticato ma...,"L'hotel √® molto bello e sofisticato, arredamenti di stile, ambienti molto puliti. La posizione √® centralissima questo ha dei pro e dei contro, i pro ovviamente che si pu√≤ arrivare in qualsiasi posto in pochi minuti, i contro √® che i rumori del centro: auto, sirene etc.. purtroppo sono molto frequenti. Il servizio ristorante lascia un p√≤ a desisderare molto freddo, il personale sembrano robot. Comunque un ottimo hotel."

Cura del dettaglio, servizio ottimo e cucina ad altissimi livelli. La migliore guancia di vitello che abbia mai mangiato. Ci ritorner√≤ di sicuro."
153026971,January 2013,4.0,Great Location,The rooms are great and the bathroom is wonderful. Location is perfect to see city by walking and very closed to famous shopping area. The hotel is so modern that's why I found atmosphere a bit cold from the lower ground but the reception stuff and the house keeping were wonderful. The service was generally great except breakfast. There weren't enough waiters to serve and they make you uncomfortable to ask for anything. The Hotel restaurant Nobu was terrible nothing like Nobu in the other cities in Europe. We asked several different meal and wine from the menu but they couldn't offer us it was all out of stock. I still would suggest to try the hotel itself.
152865512,February 2013,5.0,Bellissimo,"Hotel fantastico, nel centro di milano.Ero incuriosito, anche perch√© le recensioni non erano delle migliori. Ma poi mi sono dovuto ricredereCamere molto belle e spaziose , struttura stile Armani.Personale selezionatissimo e impeccabile, simpatico e disponibile, certo sono tutti molto giovani, ma qualche errore rende pi√π umani.Insomma un hotel al disopra degli altri, quando vado a milano sar√†' il mio albergo."
152846000,February 2013,5.0,Armani style,"Tutto in stile Armani: elegante,moderno, asettico, il colore nero,con i giusti abbinamenti, che domina nei vari ambienti del l'hotel.Dal momento del nostro arrivo tutto il personale che abbiamo incontrato si e' dimostrato molto professionali ma con un dose di cordialit√† che ti fa sentire subito molto bene.La camera (Armani deluxe) superlativa. Il top e' la stanza da bagno,grandissima in proporzione con la dimensione della camera, con una bellissima finestra che da una grande luce.La Spa, dal punto di vista sauna e piscina e' piccola ma esteticamente fantastica, per quanto riguarda la zona trattamenti invece √® molto grande con stanze massaggi che rasentano la perfezione. Ho fatto un solo massaggio(purtroppo) che √® stato eseguito in maniera impeccabile."
152763888,January 2013,5.0,A very special place.,"Wonderful concierge and serviceWe came from New Zealand and the location was excellent ,The top floor hamman and view from the enclosed pool was fantastic.Wonderful bathrooms!!We can't wait to return"
150357843,January 2013,5.0,One of the best in town,"Best location  superb rooms ,staff  and bar just like ot should be. Need to wait to be served during the breakfast. but worst Nobu Restaurant on the ground floor, didn't have three wines and 2 main course on the menu"
149934167,January 2013,4.0,Nice start,"Armani is a new comer in the hotellerie world. The one in Milan opened few months ago with still a lot of things to improve (service for example, breakfast, spa) but the location is good, the decor is charming (not too cold), people welcoming.I found very tricky the access to the rooms (you have to take an elevator to the lobby at 7th floor and after taking another elevator down to the rooms) that when you are in rush is not the fastest way to leave the hotel.The SPA is nice, but the pool is in reality a jacuzzi!!!!Breakfast and food must be improved for sure. Too average, service as well, they asked for a newspaper....never received a copy!! The room sometimes was not perfectly made (They forgot to give extra waters and change towels).The rooms facing the courtyard can give the impression of a prison as the lack of lights.I gave 4 stars as They are beginners, but if They want to become a reference They need to improve quickly"
149717160,January 2013,5.0,Non solo un'Hotel ma tantissima qualita' ed elefanza,"Hotel assolutamente perfetto ed elegante , come dal nome che porta. L'Italia e' questa e tutti ci vogliono copiare, dopo aver pernottato in questo Hotel , si capisce perche' gli standard sono altissimi."

147469430,July 2012,3.0,Good location but very average service,"I can appreciate the convenient location and design aspect of the Armani Hotel but I cannot see myself returning anytime in the near future. Each room comes equipped with ""Lifestyle Manager"" remote for 'service' however the remote seems quite pointless as despite calling for a porter three times - no response. The concierge/reception area is rather disorganised and as mentioned, there seems to be a shortage of porters in the hotel when I stayed in July. Overall, I'd say the hotel is fine to stay for a night but the average service doesn't scream 5-star. There are better hotels in the area at the same room rate."
139077936,August 2012,3.0,Style and some substance,"The Armani Hotel is a good hotel in a fantastic location. We stayed in a premium room with a very small living area, a decent sized bedroom and a great bathroom. The hotel is pretty hi tech with a remote that controls everything. The room was pretty dark and looked out on a pretty drab internal courtyard. The public areas felt a touch sterile. A bit airline lounge like. The lounge is pretty nice with great views over the city. The restaurant lacks ambiance. Breakfast was pretty good. Te service during the stay was very friendly and personable. The staff look great in their well tailored uniforms. A couple of minor misses: newspaper did not get delivered, room was not made up despite pressing the Please Make Up Room button. For 600 Euro per night I found the whole experience a good stay but not a memorable stay. We ended up having dinner at the Bulgari Hotel down the road and will most likely stay there on a future stay in Milan. More atmosphere. Warmer interiors. Better bar."
137090810,August 2012,3.0,Cold but nice,"Difficult hotel to review‚Ä¶Amazing room in terms of high-tech stuff, amenities and gadgets. The rooms are large and very modern.The whole hotel feels a bit impersonal and cold. Service is decent but concierge is awful. They send us twice to bad restaurants which I find unacceptable for a 5 stars hotel. The breakfast is expensive and very minimalist.Extremely expensive. I will not go back."
136044110,August 2012,4.0,"Location di grande effetto, atmosfera tranquilla e internazionale","Una bella sorpresa per concedersi un'aperitivo nel centro di Milano.Al Lounge Bar (7¬∞ piano) si accede da Via Manzoni (entrata Hotel).Giunti al piano, ci si ritrova in un ambiente molto luminoso e curato che offre una veduta della citt√† davvero unica: un mix di cortesia, discrezione, spazi ben studiati e un ricco cocktail men√π.Una esperienza da ripetere sicuramente.Prezzi non bassi e qualche scomodit√† al tavolo, dovute all'assenza di schienale per alcune sedute."
133915098,July 2012,5.0,The best in Milan,"Until last year Bulgari was the obvious choice when looking for a top end hotel in Milan. But things have changed a bit recently.Armani Milan is even better. Beautiful, spacious rooms, impressive spa and fitness area, great breakfast and an amazing rooftop view from the bar, that actually makes the town look more like Rome than Milan.Overall it is a very modern, luxurious and comfortable hotel. If there is one better thing that Bulgari has to offer it is the garden for drinks in the evenings and for brunch on Sundays. But apart from the lack of an open air space at the Armani it is almost flawless."
133730641,July 2012,3.0,Great hotel but bad experience.,"The hotel is in a great location if you like shopping.Its great design,may be sometimes over the top.The staff was very attentive from the doorman to the receptionists.The rooms are spacious and the bathroom one of the nicest i have seen in Italy.the restaurant was decent and service good.we however had one bad expreience:returning to the Suite after dinner we found the room to be very cold and we tried to stop the AC and Fan.no luck.We called the Lifestyle Manager and after 15 minutes a very helpfull Serviceman arrived with two heaters.We were told that there was a problem but that the engineer was off Duty and that we had to do with the heaters.28 degrees outside,18 inside and we had to use heaters!Finally the Lifestyle Manager appeared in person and she went with my wife to several Rooms until they finally found one which was cold but not quite as bad.We had to pack,they moved our staff to the other room,which had to be prepared first.this all took from 23.45 to 1.15.Important sleep missed which did not make us happy!the staff was always very helpfull but the technic failed badly!!"
132147535,May 2012,5.0,BENE BENE,"All'arrivo ho avuto un'accoglienza calorosa, mi hanno offerto un tavolo con vista Duomo al Bamboo Bar direi incantevole, e successivamente sono stato al Ristorante facendo una degustazione a base di pesce.Il cibo √® il servizio sono da lode, dire un 5 stelle lusso con i fiocchi. Lo consiglio a tutti."

131199912,May 2012,5.0,the ultimate luxury experience in town,"In the fashion district of Milan with a breathtaking view on the city. Inspiring minimal design and extreme attention to detail. Excellent staff, capable of cordiality and efficiency beyond imagination.Room service is impeccable. The restaurant, at the top of the building, shows all the city centre and the Dome trough huge glass windows two floors hight.

La camera , una de luxe , era molto confortevole, il design di tutto rispetto che non ha deluso le aspettative, la tecnologia all'avanguardia, il balcone della camera molto ampio con una vista unica.Molto gradevole l'atmosfera della longue dove ho consumato un buon aperitivo accompagnato da ottimi stuzzichini caldi e freddi.Ci torner√≤ sicuramente alla prossima occasione."
121099551,November 2011,4.0,Un lusso alternativo,"Dopo aver letto ovunque che il design delle stanze e di tutto l'arredamento era stato scelto direttamente da Re Giorgio ho deciso di regalarmi una notte nel suo nuovo hotel milanese. La posizione √®, ovviamente, fantastica, giusto sull'angolo tra via Manzoni e Montenapoleone ma entrando si prova una sensazione inedita per un hotel di tale livello. L'ingresso √® semplice ed essenziale, senza una vera reception. Si viene accolti da degli inservienti cordiali chiamati ""Life Style"" che non solo ti accompagnano in camera, ma ti mostrano, appena accennate ad un po' di curiosit√†, le altre tipologie di stanze. La differenza tra quelle standard e le suite risiede soprattutto nella metratura (ne ho vista una immensa, simile ad un vero appartamento) ma lo stile √® sempre quello: linee squadrate, materiali di pregio, tinte opache ovunque, pochissimi soprammobili. La Lounge offre una bella vista ed √® apprezzabile soprattutto durante il crepuscolo, sebbene molto affollata. L√¨ abbiamo aspettato qualche minuto di troppo per i nostri drink, che per√≤ si sono rivelati poi molto buoni. Ma in realt√† a colpire non sono gli ambienti quanto la cordialit√† del personale: ci si sente coccolati dai consierge, purtroppo quasi indispensabili ad aprire le durissime e pesantissime (sebbene insonorizzate) porte di ingresso delle stanze. Ma √® stato un aneddoto serale ad avermi colpito, spingendomi a scrivere la recensione: un addetto al room service, portandomi dei cioccolatini gratuiti, ha guardato per un istante lo schermo del mio netbook e con voce quasi squillante mi ha detto ""posso farle scomparire questo errore!"". Dopo due minuti sulla tastiera mi ha liberato di un piccolo errore che mi appariva solitamente mentre navigavo. Mi rendo conto che si tratta solo di fortuna, ma la bont√† di un servizio la si nota anche da questi dettagli. Se siete delle appassionate di moda e volete passare un breve weekend da sogno con le amiche non abbiate indugi e prendete con calma le lungaggini del bar principale, godendovi il panorama. C'√® anche una spa, che per√≤ non ho avuto il tempo di gustare, torner√≤!"
