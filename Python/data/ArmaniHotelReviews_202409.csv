869387650,November 2022,5.0,I love this hotel,"It is truly difficult to find a flaw in this hotel because it is simply perfect. To start with, the reservation staff was patient and courteous, they even called us before we arrived to make sure everything was alright. Then from the moment we walked in, we were greeted with kindness. Then they upgraded us to an executive suite without us even asking.It kept getting better from that moment on. The bathroom is so comfortable and spacious, the AC worked wonderfly, and the amenities covered everything from the toothbrush to everything else. The suit was smart and we were able to control everything with an eye pad. Relaxing music was always playing in the  hallways. There was a business center. The breakfast was by far the best I ever had in a hotel. Housekeeping was always fast to respond. The room service was absolutely delicious. The location is in the city center. Really, I love this hotel."
889405632,May 2023,5.0,Outstanding time at Armani in Milan,Fantastic experience at the Armani Hotel in Milan.  From the moment of arrival until I left the staff at the hotel went out of their way to make my trip completely enjoyable.  Virtually all the staff recognized me by my name on each encounter.  The Jr Suite was perfect in every respect including the desk area where I needed to work for a couple of hours each day.  Restaurant at d bar were excellent  as was the fitness level.   And the location is spectacular.   Will definitely go back ASAP.
779338587,October 2020,5.0,Great Milano Hotel - Very Well Located,"This hotel is all you expect from Armani. Design, size of the room etc. Really enjoyed my time there. I was only disappointed by the Concierge service which was not able to help organize or reserve anything for me. A bit bad in such a great hotel."
837733277,May 2022,5.0,Thank you Lifestyle team,"This hotel deserves a lot more than the flak reviews you read.First time staying here for our anniversary.The hotel room is nice and comfortable. Mini bar complimentary - which is a really really nice touch.Special thanks and mention to Paolo from front desk. He was so patient with the check, trying to find us a room on a higher floor and when he couldn't, he brought us to the room allocated and walked us through the room details like lights, ipad etc. We had a small issue but he resolved it promptly and efficiently and really showed what it means to stay at The Armani - fantastic customer service! Just top notch! Thank you to the service team and front desk. We really enjoyed our stay.The only thing that we would like to suggest is an improvement of the WiFi. We stayed on the 3rd floor and the WiFi was patchy.But other than that, it was such a fantastic stay and thanks in no small part to Paolo.Stay here! Nice, central location, great breakfast and fabulous service."
923971481,October 2023,5.0,Stylish Armani in stylish Milan,"What an amazing stay! Totally stylish and such a reprieve in the middle of a bustling city. The location was incredibly central, you could easily walk to all the hotspots. The Armani amenities were amazing, all the bath products, the drinks and snacks in the room, even stylish slippers. They really thought of everything! It was visually stunning and the perfect spot to enjoy Milan from!"
793435259,June 2021,5.0,Amazing....every time,"I love everything about the Armani hotel, one week ago was my 4th time there and everything its always amazing. The service is excellent, they always think one step ahead to fulfill any wishes (even the man from the valet parking when we ask him if they had an item of personal care in the hotel or if there was some pharmacy around: he just told the housekeeping and this item was in our bathroom when we came back).  Service is great, the location is great, the breakfast, the branding with their own fragrance, creams, snacks, chocolates, etc...its perfect, one of my favorite hotel!"
904077271,July 2023,3.0,First class team,The team at the Armani were amongst the best I’ve ever encountered. Friendly and helpful at every turn. Breakfast was truly amazing with unbelievably fresh fruit and vegetables. The room technology was cumbersome and overdone but the team was always there to help out. Overall we enjoyed our stay though I believe I would choose a bit more of a full service hotel in the future for the price point.
797695140,July 2021,4.0,Everything is beautiful about this hotel except the duty manager,"The Hotel is a 'go-to' place with an amazing design but it's people who do it. I want to say 'thank you' to Meghan from reception, be sure if you address her your request will be fulfilled efficiently. Restaurants have friendly and welcoming personnel but Lilia, Biagio and Pasquale are outstanding! Contrary if you don't want to spoil your mood avoid Luca with his arrogant and moody attitude and you will enjoy the property to the full!"
837350044,April 2022,5.0,Enjoyable trip,"It is not the first time we visit Milan but it is the first time in Armani Hotel, it was great that we chose this hotel, its location, quality of rooms, services and staff, everything was great, I will never forget Mr. Faisal, Mr. Simone and Mrs. Lara, and I apologize for forgetting the other names.Thank you everyone for their kindness to my children.The room type was a family suite consisting of two interconnecting rooms."
815655696,October 2021,4.0,"Good location, sleek hotel","Very sleek hotel and impressive to see. The location is excellent as it is just steps from high end shopping and walkable to the Duomo. The lounge and dining area are also very modern and cool. My criticism is the rooms themselves were not very functional, specifically the bathroom. There is almost no counter space for makeup. There are not many outlets. The outlet in the bathroom didn’t work, so I had to curl my hair sitting in the floor, using the refrigerator door as a mirror. The use of an iPad to control everything seems cool initially, but became annoying to turn on the lights and turn off the TV. Armani hotel is a nice hotel, but can use some modern updates to make it more functional."
